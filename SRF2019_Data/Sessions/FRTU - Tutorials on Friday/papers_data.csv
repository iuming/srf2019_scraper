FRTU - Tutorials on Friday,FRTU1,Superconducting Cavities of Interesting Shapes (Non-Elliptical Cavities),"ODU; Norfolk; Virginia; USA; The Superconducting Cavities of Interesting Shapes¿ tutorial introduces the basics of non-elliptical cavities. The non-elliptical cavity types discussed includes cavities for accelerating particle beams and deflecting and crabbing beams. The types of cavities are categorized based on electromagnetic field profiles for easier understanding and characterization of cavity properties. The quarte wave resonator; half wave resonator and spoke cavities are discussed in detail. The practical applications of such cavities are also discussed for both accelerating and deflecting/crabbing cavities. Further details of cavity selection for different applications and mechanical properties are also presented.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS; FRIB; East Lansing; Michigan; USA; The ""Cavity Processing and Cleanroom Assembly Review of Literature"" tutorial will introduce basics for SRF cavity processing and cleanroom techniques based on published processes. The practical applications presented will focus on low beta quarter-wave and half-wave cavities; however there are many publications on elliptical cavity processing and cleanroom assembly available online and in past tutorials. Topics discussed include: SRF coldmass and cavity workflow; SRF cavity receiving and inspection; degreasing; ultra pure water and high pressure rinse; mechanical surface preparation; removal by chemical etching; preparation by electro polishing; safety considerations; heat treatments; cleanroom protocols; and cleanroom assembly techniques.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS; Pushing Bulk Nb Limits (High Q; High Gradient; Reliable SRF Accelerators); Fermilab; Batavia; Illinois; USA; Superconducting RF technology for particle accelerators have come a long way but still have huge and unexplored potential. SRF technology state of the art cavities have gradients up to 50 MV/m and quality factors exceeding 5·1010 at 2K; 1.3 GHz; 2·1011 at 1.5K; 2·1010 at 4.2K (Nb3Sn). SRF is now at the beginning of a new phase. The next factor of 2-3 will require a strong focus on: Physics of SRF surface (material science tools. As much involvement as possible of superconductivity theory experts with strong ties to technology centers/labs. Long term to focus on: what is the ultimate limit for achievable gradients and Q? Can we go to 100 MV/m or more? We need to understand the ultimate limitations and explore pathways forward.; ※ BibTeX; ※ LaTeX; ※ Text/Word; ※ RIS; CEA-IRFU; Gif-sur-Yvette; France; Materials Beyond Bulk Nb Bulk Niobium is approaching its ultimate limits.
