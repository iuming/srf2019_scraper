   Title: Modeling of Superconducting Spoke Cavity with its Control Loops Systems for the MYRRHA Linac Project
   Authors: ACS, Orsay, France, LPSC, Grenoble Cedex, France, N. Gandolfo, C. Joly, Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS/IN2P3, IJCLab, Orsay, France, In the construction framework of a future 600 MeV/4 mA CW Superconducting Linac accelerator for the MYRRHA project at SCK•CEN (Mol, Belgium), modeling works under Matlab/Simulink are carried out upstream to understand the behaviour of 352 MHz single Spoke cavity with its environment and its associated feedback control loops (LLRF and cold tuning system). One of the main goal is to assess the feasibility of cavity failure compensation in the Superconducting Linac. Indeed, stringent reliability requirements must be fulfilled to ensure an efficient operation of the MYRRHA Accelerator Driven System: unexpected beam interruptions, due to failures, must be compensated in less than 3 seconds. Our preliminary study focuses on the fast frequency re-tuning of the cavity and the power balances. Our goal is to prepare the R&D tests foreseen at IPN Orsay on a prototype cryomodule including two SC Spoke cavities equipped with couplers, tuners with feedback loop and connected to dedicate LLRF., Nicolas Gandolfo, IPNO, Orsay (France)  Christophe Joly, IPNO, Orsay (France) Frédéric Bouly, LPSC, Grenoble (France), ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, M. Basten, M. Busch, T. Conrad, H. Podlech, M. Schwarz, IAP, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, K. Aulenbacher, W.A. Barth, C. Burandt, F.D. Dziuba, V. Gettmann, M. Heilmann, T. Kürzeder, S. Lauber, J. List, M. Miski-Oglu, J. Salvatore, A. Schnase, S. Yaramyshev, GSI, Darmstadt, Germany, K. Aulenbacher, W.A. Barth, C. Burandt, F.D. Dziuba, V. Gettmann, T. Kürzeder, S. Lauber, J. List, M. Miski-Oglu, HIM, Mainz, Germany, K. Aulenbacher, S. Lauber, IKP, Mainz, Germany, F.D. Dziuba, J. List, KPH, Mainz, Germany, The upcoming FAIR (Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research) project at GSI will use the existing UNILAC (UNIversal Linear Accelerator) as an injector, reducing the beam time for the ambitious Super Heavy Element (SHE) program. To keep the UNILAC user program competitive a new superconducting (sc) continuous wave (cw) high intensity heavy ion LINAC should provide ion beams with max. duty factor above the coulomb barrier. The fundamental sc LINAC design comprises a low energy beam transport (LEBT)-section followed by a sc Drift Tube Linac (DTL) consisting of sc Crossbar-H-mode (CH) structures for acceleration up to 7.3 MeV/u. The latest milestones towards the new cw LINAC HELIAC (HELmholtz LInear ACcelerator) have been the successful tests and commissioning of the first demonstrator section with heavy ion beam in 2017 and 218 as well as the successful test under cryogenic conditions of the second CH-cavity in 2018. Now the third CH-cavity has been tested at cryogenic temperatures of 4 Kelvin at the Institute for Applied Physics (IAP) at Goethe University Frankfurt (GUF). The results of these measurements as well as the status of the HELIAC-project will be presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, T. Conrad, M. Basten, M. Busch, H. Podlech, M. Schwarz, IAP, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, K. Aulenbacher, W.A. Barth, F.D. Dziuba, V. Gettmann, T. Kürzeder, S. Lauber, J. List, M. Miski-Oglu, HIM, Mainz, Germany, KPH, Mainz, Germany, W.A. Barth, M. Heilmann, A. Rubin, A. Schnase, S. Yaramyshev, GSI, Darmstadt, Germany, In collaboration of GSI, HIM and Goethe University Frankfurt new designs for the CH-DTL cavities of the proposed Helmholtz Linear Accelerator (HELIAC) are developed. The cw-mode operated linac with a final energy of 7.3 MeV/u is intended for various experiments, especially with heavy ions at energies near the coulomb barrier. Currently twelve superconducting CH-cavities are considered which will be split into four different cryostats. Each cavity will be equipped with dynamic bellow tuners. After successful beam tests with CH0 as well as last surface preparations and ongoing rf tests with CH1 and CH2, CH3 to CH11 will be designed. Based on the successful test results, individual optimizations are carried out on the cavity design. Attention was paid to reduce production costs, for example by keeping the cavity diameter in each cryostat constant despite varying particle velocities and gap numbers. In addition to reaching the resonance frequency of 216.816 MHz and the influence of the bellow tuners on the frequency, the mechanical stability of the bellow tuners, the thermal effects on the cavity and the measures to mitigate secondary electron emission are investigated., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, J. Tamura, K. Hasegawa, Y. Kondo, F.M. Maekawa, S.I. Meigo, B. Yee-Rendón, JAEA/J-PARC, Tokai-mura, Japan, E. Kako, T. Konomi, H. Sakai, K. Umemori, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, The Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) is proposing an accelerator-driven subcritical system (ADS) as a future project to transmute long-lived nuclides to short-lived or stable ones. In the JAEA-ADS, a high-power proton beam of 30 MW with a final beam energy of 1.5 GeV is required with a high reliability. Furthermore, the accelerator needs to be operated in a continuous wave mode in order to be compatible with the reactor operation. As the first step toward the detailed design of the JAEA-ADS linac, we are planning to demonstrate a high-field measurement by prototyping a low-beta single spoke resonator (SSR1). We performed the electromagnetic design, and confirmed that the cavity performances of the SSR1 model with and without dimensional constraint., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, IHEP, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, Higher order modes (HOMs) may af{}fect beam stability and refrigeration requirements of superconducting cavity such as the 166.6~MHz superconducting(SC) cavity, which is studied at IHEP. Under certain conditions beam-induced HOMs can accumulate suf{}f{}icient energy to destabilize the beam or quench the SC cavities. In order to limit these ef{}fects, we considers the use of coaxial HOM couplers on the cut-of{}f tubes of the SC cavity. However, HOMs cannot be ef{}fectively extracted by HOM couplers. Therefore, it is necessary to design a HOMs extraction structure to introduce the dangerous modes from the cavity into the bundle tube, which are designed to couple to potentially dangerous modes while suf{}ficiently rejecting the fundamental mode. The HOMs extraction structure consists of an enlarged tubes, a coaxial structure, and the petal. The extraction of the dangerous modes and the suppression of the fundamental mode are realized by the petal structure and the coaxial structure. In order to verify the designs, a rapid prototype for the favored structure was fabricated and characterized on a low-power test-stand., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, X.Y. Zhang, X.R. Hao, D.B. Li, Z.Q. Li, H.Y. Lin, Q. Ma, Z.H. Mi, Q.Y. Wang, P. Zhang, IHEP, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, A 166.6 MHz quarter-wave β=1 superconducting proof-of-principle cavity has been designed and recently been dressed with a helium jacket, fundamental power coupler and tuner. The cavity was subsequently installed in a modified cryomodule and tested in a horizontal manner at both 4.2 K and 2 K. The helium jacket was successfully developed with a focus on minimizing frequency shift due to helium pressure fluctuation while retaining a reasonable tuning range. The Lorentz force detuning (LFD) and microphonics were also optimized during the design. The df/dp and LFD coefficient were measured to be -3.1 Hz/mbar and -0.8 Hz/(MV/m)2. These are in good agreement with simulations. Future work is mainly to reduce the stiffness of the cavity and further suppress the vibration mode of the inner conductor., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, M. Chen, S. Chen, A.Q. Cheng, J.K. Hao, K.X. Liu, Y.Q. Liu, D.M. Ouyang, S.W. Quan, F. Zhu, PKU, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, CIAE, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, BISOL(Beijing Isotope-Separation-On-Line Neutron-Rich Beam Facility) is a new generation radioactive ion beam(RIB) facility[1]. It consists a CARR nuclear reactor, a high intensity deuteron accelerator and a post accelera-tor. QWR085 cavity is supposed to be used in SCL2 of post accelerator. This paper mainly talks about the elec-tromagnetic design, mechanical design and vibration damper design of QWR085., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, P. Dhakal, G. Ciovati, G.R. Myneni, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, We presented the RF measurement on a 1.3 GHz single cell cavity fabricated at KEK using large grain ingot niobium with RRR=107. The cavity reached to 35 MV/m with Q0 = 2.0×10zEhNZeHn at 2.0 K, record performance on the cavity made from medium purity ingot niobium. The cavity was cool down with different temperature gradient along the cavity axis in order to understand the flux expulsion mechanism when the cavity does through the superconducting transition and effect of trap residual magnetic field on the residual resistance. The measurement showed the excellent flux expulsion with the flux trapping sensitivity of 0.29 nΩ/mG for electro polished surface and 0.44 nΩ/mG for cavity followed by low temperature baking at 120°C for 12 hours., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, RIKEN Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science, Wako, Saitama, Japan, O. Kamigaito, N. Sakamoto, T. Watanabe, Y. Watanabe, K. Yamada, RIKEN Nishina Center, Wako, Japan, SHI Accelerator Service Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, Upgrades of the RIKEN heavy-ion linac (RILAC) involving a new superconducting linac (SRILAC) are undergoing to promote super-heavy element searches at the RIKEN radioactive isotope beam factory (RIBF). Stable ultra-high vacuum (<10-8 Pa) and particulate-free conditions are strictly necessary for keeping the performance of the superconductive radio frequency (SRF) cavities of the SRILAC. It is crucially important to develop neighboring warm sections to prevent contamination from the existing old RILAC and beamlines built almost four decades ago. In the present study, non-evaporative getter-based differential pumping systems were newly developed to achieve the pressure reduction from the existing beamline vacuum (10-5–10-6 Pa ) to the ultra-high vacuum within very limited length (<80 cm) ensuring the large beam aperture of more than 40 mm. They are also equipped with compact electrostatic particle removers. We will describe and discuss details of the design, construction and performance of the system., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, M. Parise, D. Passarelli, F. Ruiu, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, P. Duchesne, D. Longuevergne, D. Reynet, Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS/IN2P3, IJCLab, Orsay, France, A total of 35 Superconducting SSR2 spoke cavities will be installed in the PIP II SRF linac at Fermilab and a total of 8 prototype SSR2 cavities will be manufactured for the prototype cryomodule. In this paper, the mechanical design and fabrication aspects of the prototype jacketed SSR2 cavity will be presented. RF and mechanical design activities were conducted in parallel directly on the jacketed cavity in order to minimize the number of design iterations. Also, the lessons learned from other spoke cavities experiences (i.e. SSR1 at Fermilab and ESS double spoke at IPNO) were considered since the early stage of the design., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, S.V. Kutsaev, R.B. Agustsson, P.R. Carriere, A. Moro, A.Yu. Smirnov, K.V. Taletski, RadiaBeam, Santa Monica, California, USA, A.N. Cleland, É. Dumur, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA, ANL, Lemont, Illinois, USA, MEPhI, Moscow, Russia, Quantum computers (QC), if realized, could disrupt many computationally intense fields of science. The building block element of a QC is a quantum bit (qubit). Qubits enable the use of quantum superposition and multi-state entanglement in QC calculations, allowing a QC to simultaneously calculate millions of computations at once. However, quantum states stored in a qubit degrade with decreased quality factors and interactions with the environment. One technical solution to improve qubit lifetimes and network interactions is a circuit comprised of a Josephson junction located inside of a high Q-factor superconducting 3D cavity. RadiaBeam, in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory and The University of Chicago, has developed a superconducting radio-frequency quarter-wave resonant cavity (QWR) for quantum computation. Here a 6 GHz QWR was optimized to include tapering of the inner and outer conductors, a toroidal shape for the resonator shorting plane, and the inner conductor to reduce parasitic capacitance. In this paper, we present the results of the qubit cavity design optimization, fabrication, processing and testing in a single-photon regime at mK temperatures., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, T. Reid, Z.A. Conway, B.M. Guilfoyle, M. Kedzie, M.P. Kelly, M.K. Ng, ANL, Lemont, Illinois, USA, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) has extended high quality cavity processing techniques based on those developed for the International Linear Collider to several more complex superconducting RF cavities. Recently, these include a bunch lengthening harmonic cavity, a crabbing rf-dipole cavity, a compact half-wave cavity, and both medium and high frequency elliptical cavities. These systems are an improved version of the one originally developed for 1.3 GHz 9-cell cavities and include a second rotating electrical contact that can support multiple cathodes, necessary for optimum polishing in difficult cavity geometries. All include the possibility for external water cooling., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, M. Fouaidy, F. Chatelet, V. Delpech, F. Galet, D. Le Dréan, R. Martret, G. Olry, T. Pépin-Donat, Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS/IN2P3, IJCLab, Orsay, France, M. Baudrier, P. Carbonnier, E. Fayette, X. Hanus, Th. Proslier, D. Roudier, P. Sahuquet, C. Servouin, CEA-DRF-IRFU, France, E. Cenni, L. Maurice, CEA-IRFU, Gif-sur-Yvette, France, FLUO, Orsay, France, In the framework of ESS, a vacuum furnace dedicated to High Temperature Heat Treatment under Vacuum (VH2T2) of SRF bulk Nb cavities was developed and commissioned in May 2016. This furnace is currently used for interstitial hydrogen removal (10h00 @ 650 °C) of two type of cavities: 1) the whole series of 26 ESS 352 MHz spoke resonators equipped with their Ti LHe tank well, 2) some prototypes of ESS high beta and medium beta cavities. Up to know IPN Orsay VH2T2 (10h00 @ 650 °C) was successfully applied to more than 16 cavities. In this paper we will first report about these VH2T2 tests. Finally, we have just started testing nitrogen infusion and nitrogen doping processes on samples and 1.3 GHz cavities: the preliminary results will be discussed., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, L. Steder, D. Reschke, DESY, Hamburg, Germany, DESY is and was very active in R&D related to SRF cavities. Many single and nine cell cavities with different surface treatment histories were tested vertically. Results of these cold tests are accelerating gradient and quality factor of the cavities. Using the large number of available datasets the parameters of the 120°C bake procedure, which is applied to avoid high-field Q-slope, are analysed. The impact of different durations and temperatures on accelerating gradient, quality factor and residual resistance is studied in detail and is compared to results obtained with the recently proposed procedure of modified low temperature bake. For this procedure additional four hours at temperatures around 75°C are implemented before the standard bake at about 120°C. Since the claim is, that cavities treated with such a modified procedure achieve extra-ordinary large accelerating gradients it is a very interesting research field for the European XFEL continuous wave mode upgrade. For this purpose cavities with high quality factors are needed, but in addition large maximal accelerating fields are required to maintain high energies in the pulsed operation mode of the accelerator., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, K.N. Nii, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, We have been carrying out R&D on vertical electropolishing (VEP) technique to establish it as an alternate of the horizontal EP (HEP) technique used for the surface treatment of niobium (Nb) superconducting RF (SRF) cavities. We have earlier reported on a VEP parameter study for 1.3 GHz single and nine-cell Nb cavities. The optimized VEP parameters and a unique rotating cathode yielded uniform removal and a smooth surface in the single cell cavity. The unique cathode and a dual flow mechanism for acid circulation were applied to improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. The vertically electropolished single and nine cell cavities achieved the same RF performance as achieved after the HEP processes. We are making efforts to further improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. Here, we report on a VEP of the 1.3 GHz Nb nine-cell cavity at a higher cathode rotation speed of 50 rpm. The VEP results reveal that the speed could be considered for improving the uniformity in removal while maintaining the surface smoothness. Required improvements in the VEP facility and acid flow condition for achieving uniform EP and a smooth surface are also described., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, F. Furuta, D.J. Bicepresenter, A.C. Crawford, T.J. Ring, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, Electro-chemical Polishing (EP) is one of the key technologies of surface treatments for niobium superconducting cavities. We have established a single-cell scale horizontal electro-polishing facility at Fermilab and routinely processed the niobium cavities with the frequencies of 1.3 GHz to 3.9 GHz. The precise control of EP parameters, especially the temperatures of cavity outside wall, allows the uniform removal over the cell with the variation of ±15%.

Indeed, the mechanical polishing is fun-damental also in the superconducting thin film resonant cavities in which one of the main issues that limits the per-formances is the surface preparation. A promising vi-bro-tumbling technique is being studied and implemented with a possibility to replace or improve mechanical treat-ment steps (grinding, barrel polishing). The simplic-ity of the technology allows it to adapt to any cavity geom-etry, both for Nb and Cu materials. The presented work contains last results on 6 GHz cavities obtained at LNL-INFN, both Nb bulk and Cu cavities., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, K.N. Nii, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, Marui Galvanizing Co., Ltd. has been developing vertical electropolishing (VEP) technology for single and nine-cell niobium superconducting radio frequency cavities using a unique cathode namely Ninja cathode in collaboration with KEK. The VEP process usually results in non-uniform removal with a large asymmetry along the cavity length. In order to suppress the asymmetry in removal, we are making different approaches. Flipping of the cavity during the VEP process is one of the approaches applied so far. A unique VEP setup, which allows the flipping of a multi-cell cavity, has been developed as reported earlier. Here, we report the improvement in the setup with automation for cavity flipping. VEP experiments were conducted with the improved system. VEP parameters were studied and the VEP results including the removal trend are discussed in detail., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Y.I. Ida, V. Chouhan, K.N. Niipresenter, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, T. Akabori, G. Mitoya, K. Miyano, HKK, Morioka, Japan, Y. Anetai, F. Takahashi, WING. Co.Ltd, Iwate-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, M. Sawabe, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, The 1st report was delivered in May, 2018 at the IPAC 18 in Vancouver, Canada. The 2nd report was delivered in September, 2018 at the LINAC 18 in Beijing, China. We will make our 3rd report in July, 2019 at the SRF-19 in Dresden, Germany. There will be two main points this time. The first is that by using our improved Ninja Electrode Premium, we can out-perform our number one and number two competitors in terms of uniform electropolishing of the interior of the 9-cell cavity. The second point is that we can remove hydrogen gas, reacted during electropolishing, from the cavity chambers in a manner that has not been successfully achieved by 1st report, May 2018 and 2nd report, September 2018. We will report our 9-cell vertical polishing revolver-type unit that solves the above two problems., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, While the basic process of electropolishing niobium with 1:9 HF:H2SO4 electrolyte has been well characterized, the specific process parameters used to electropolish different superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity geometries requires thoughtful attention. One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization. In preparation for SNS PPU project, JLab performed some EP process development runs with SNS high beta cavities to help identify viable parameter regimes for communication to cavity vendors.

Developing the methods and tools for collecting and characterizing particles found in an accelerator enables process development towards field emission free SRF cavities. Methods are presented for sampling assemblies, components, processes, and environmental conditions utilizing forensic techniques with specialized tooling. Sampling activities to date have produced an inventory of over 850 GSR spindles. Traditional SEM + EDS analysis of this volume of spindles is challenged by labor investment, spindle sampling methods, and the subsequent data pipeline which ultimately results in a statically inadequate dataset for any particulate distribution characterization. A complete systematic analysis of the spindles is enabled by third party software controlling SEM automation for EDS data acquisition.

An R&D program has started at DESY, to prepare for a CW upgrade. Cryomodules are being tested in CW mode in our CryoModule Test Bench (CMTB) to study the performance and main issues for such an operation mode. Sensitivity to vibration causing microphonics is one of the main concerns for the CW operation in mode. Therefore a detailed analysis is being performed to evaluate the frequency spectrum of the EXFEL cryomodule main components: the cavity itself, the cavity string, the cold mass and the vacuum vessel. Finite Element Modal Analyses have been performed and the results compared with data measured at the CMTB.

The cavities have design loaded-Q of 4×107, which means that it has a control bandwidth of 16 Hz. The JLab prototype cryomodule was instrumented with a series of seven accelerometers, and impulse hammer response measurements were made while the cryomodule was being built and after it was installed in the JLab cryomodule test facility. This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz. Results of the modal analysis as well as the background microphonics observed when operated under various cryogenic conditions and with different modifications will be presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, B. Schriefer, W. Anders, A. Heugel, H. Hoffmann, G. Mielczarek, H. Stein, HZB, Berlin, Germany, In Berlin-Adlershof the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) is constructing the energy recovery linac ¿BERLinPro¿.

In this project, a new superconducting (SC) booster linac, so-called SRILAC, is being developed and constructed. The SRILAC consists of 10 TEM quarter-wavelength resonators made of pure niobium sheets which operate at 4 K. The target performance of each cavity is set as Q0 of 1×109 with its accelerating gradient of 6.8 MV/m. Recently we succeeded to develop high performance SC-cavities which satisfies the requirement with a wide margin.

These modules are based on the ELBE modules of the Helmholtz Center Dresden-Rossendorf but are modified to suit the high current and energy-recovering operation at MESA. The energy gain per module per turn should be 25 MeV, provided by two TESLA cavities, which were vertically tested at DESY, Hamburg, Germany. These tests showed an excellent performance of the quench limit and quality factor for three out of the four cavities.

The measurements were performed for fully assembled cavities as well as for bare niobium cavities without the titanium jacket. In the procedure, the instantaneous resonant frequencies were measured for 10 seconds at a time interval of 1 ms and were recorded as a time series. The frequencies were analyzed by means of conventional signal analysis. The power spectrum was deduced from the autocorrelation function calculated with the fluctuation of resonant frequencies. Although the vibration amplitudes were smaller in the cavities assembled with the titanium jacket, we could not find a clear reason for this., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Ab-initio Study of Atomic Scale Interaction Among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O, A.B. Tesfamichael, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, We employed a combination of ab-initio calculations and statistical mechanical models to understand the nature of atomic scale interaction among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O. Because of the profound nature of the interaction, we began our study by focusing only on the interaction of Nb with Sn in the absence of Cl and O. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we calculated: (1), binding energy of both vacant and interstitial of the super cell for both Nb and Sn atoms (2), rate of diffusion and re-evaporation upon transportation of Sn atom across z-axis from bulk Nb layer (3), electron transfer and electric field upon transportation of Sn atom both across z-axis and xy-plane from bulk Nb layer. Our calculation indicated 30-40% difference from experimental results.

We study the thermodynamics of impurities and hydrides in the near-surface region as well as their effect on the surface band gap. This makes it possible for experimentalists to relate changes in STM dI/dV measurements resulting from different preparations to changes in subsurface structure. We also calculate matrix elements for electron-impurity scattering in Nb for common impurities O, N, C, and H. By transforming these matrix elements into a Wannier function basis, we calculate lifetimes for a dense set of states on the Fermi surface and determine the mean free path as a function of impurity density.

Here we report extensive numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under the strong rf magnetic field. The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force. We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases, Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities.

It was found TD niobium required a lower annealing temperature (900°C) to obtain satisfactory flux expulsion characteristics compared to NX which required a slightly higher annealing temperature (950°-975°C). In order to ensure the new TD material performed equivalent to the niobium produced 4 year before after 900°C annealing; each heat lot of niobium had its flux expulsion characteristics parametrized and custom thermal treatments developed for each lot.

To keep the UNILAC user program competitive a new superconducting (sc) continuous wave (cw) high intensity heavy ion LINAC should provide ion beams with max. duty factor above the coulomb barrier. The fundamental sc LINAC design comprises a low energy beam transport (LEBT)-section followed by a sc Drift Tube Linac (DTL) consisting of sc Crossbar-H-mode (CH) structures for acceleration up to 7.3 MeV/u. The latest milestones towards the new cw LINAC HELIAC (HELmholtz LInear ACcelerator) have been the successful tests and commissioning of the first demonstrator section with heavy ion beam in 2017 and 218 as well as the successful test under cryogenic conditions of the second CH-cavity in 2018. Now the third CH-cavity has been tested at cryogenic temperatures of 4 Kelvin at the Institute for Applied Physics (IAP) at Goethe University Frankfurt (GUF). The results of these measurements as well as the status of the HELIAC-project will be presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, T. Conrad, M. Basten, M. Busch, H. Podlech, M. Schwarz, IAP, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, K. Aulenbacher, W.A. Barth, F.D. Dziuba, V. Gettmann, T. Kürzeder, S. Lauber, J. List, M. Miski-Oglu, HIM, Mainz, Germany, KPH, Mainz, Germany, W.A. Barth, M. Heilmann, A. Rubin, A. Schnase, S. Yaramyshev, GSI, Darmstadt, Germany, In collaboration of GSI, HIM and Goethe University Frankfurt new designs for the CH-DTL cavities of the proposed Helmholtz Linear Accelerator (HELIAC) are developed. The cw-mode operated linac with a final energy of 7.3 MeV/u is intended for various experiments, especially with heavy ions at energies near the coulomb barrier. Currently twelve superconducting CH-cavities are considered which will be split into four different cryostats. Each cavity will be equipped with dynamic bellow tuners. After successful beam tests with CH0 as well as last surface preparations and ongoing rf tests with CH1 and CH2, CH3 to CH11 will be designed. Based on the successful test results, individual optimizations are carried out on the cavity design. Attention was paid to reduce production costs, for example by keeping the cavity diameter in each cryostat constant despite varying particle velocities and gap numbers. In addition to reaching the resonance frequency of 216.816 MHz and the influence of the bellow tuners on the frequency, the mechanical stability of the bellow tuners, the thermal effects on the cavity and the measures to mitigate secondary electron emission are investigated., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, J. Tamura, K. Hasegawa, Y. Kondo, F.M. Maekawa, S.I. Meigo, B. Yee-Rendón, JAEA/J-PARC, Tokai-mura, Japan, E. Kako, T. Konomi, H. Sakai, K. Umemori, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, The Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) is proposing an accelerator-driven subcritical system (ADS) as a future project to transmute long-lived nuclides to short-lived or stable ones. In the JAEA-ADS, a high-power proton beam of 30 MW with a final beam energy of 1.5 GeV is required with a high reliability. Furthermore, the accelerator needs to be operated in a continuous wave mode in order to be compatible with the reactor operation. As the first step toward the detailed design of the JAEA-ADS linac, we are planning to demonstrate a high-field measurement by prototyping a low-beta single spoke resonator (SSR1). We performed the electromagnetic design, and confirmed that the cavity performances of the SSR1 model with and without dimensional constraint., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, IHEP, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, Higher order modes (HOMs) may af{}fect beam stability and refrigeration requirements of superconducting cavity such as the 166.6~MHz superconducting(SC) cavity, which is studied at IHEP. Under certain conditions beam-induced HOMs can accumulate suf{}f{}icient energy to destabilize the beam or quench the SC cavities. In order to limit these ef{}fects, we considers the use of coaxial HOM couplers on the cut-of{}f tubes of the SC cavity. However, HOMs cannot be ef{}fectively extracted by HOM couplers. Therefore, it is necessary to design a HOMs extraction structure to introduce the dangerous modes from the cavity into the bundle tube, which are designed to couple to potentially dangerous modes while suf{}ficiently rejecting the fundamental mode. The HOMs extraction structure consists of an enlarged tubes, a coaxial structure, and the petal. The extraction of the dangerous modes and the suppression of the fundamental mode are realized by the petal structure and the coaxial structure. In order to verify the designs, a rapid prototype for the favored structure was fabricated and characterized on a low-power test-stand., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, X.Y. Zhang, X.R. Hao, D.B. Li, Z.Q. Li, H.Y. Lin, Q. Ma, Z.H. Mi, Q.Y. Wang, P. Zhang, IHEP, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, A 166.6 MHz quarter-wave β=1 superconducting proof-of-principle cavity has been designed and recently been dressed with a helium jacket, fundamental power coupler and tuner. The cavity was subsequently installed in a modified cryomodule and tested in a horizontal manner at both 4.2 K and 2 K. The helium jacket was successfully developed with a focus on minimizing frequency shift due to helium pressure fluctuation while retaining a reasonable tuning range. The Lorentz force detuning (LFD) and microphonics were also optimized during the design. The df/dp and LFD coefficient were measured to be -3.1 Hz/mbar and -0.8 Hz/(MV/m)2.

Stable ultra-high vacuum (<10-8 Pa) and particulate-free conditions are strictly necessary for keeping the performance of the superconductive radio frequency (SRF) cavities of the SRILAC. It is crucially important to develop neighboring warm sections to prevent contamination from the existing old RILAC and beamlines built almost four decades ago. In the present study, non-evaporative getter-based differential pumping systems were newly developed to achieve the pressure reduction from the existing beamline vacuum (10-5–10-6 Pa ) to the ultra-high vacuum within very limited length (<80 cm) ensuring the large beam aperture of more than 40 mm.

Qubits enable the use of quantum superposition and multi-state entanglement in QC calculations, allowing a QC to simultaneously calculate millions of computations at once. However, quantum states stored in a qubit degrade with decreased quality factors and interactions with the environment. One technical solution to improve qubit lifetimes and network interactions is a circuit comprised of a Josephson junction located inside of a high Q-factor superconducting 3D cavity.

This furnace is currently used for interstitial hydrogen removal (10h00 @ 650 °C) of two type of cavities: 1) the whole series of 26 ESS 352 MHz spoke resonators equipped with their Ti LHe tank well, 2) some prototypes of ESS high beta and medium beta cavities. Up to know IPN Orsay VH2T2 (10h00 @ 650 °C) was successfully applied to more than 16 cavities. In this paper we will first report about these VH2T2 tests.

Many single and nine cell cavities with different surface treatment histories were tested vertically. Results of these cold tests are accelerating gradient and quality factor of the cavities. Using the large number of available datasets the parameters of the 120°C bake procedure, which is applied to avoid high-field Q-slope, are analysed. The impact of different durations and temperatures on accelerating gradient, quality factor and residual resistance is studied in detail and is compared to results obtained with the recently proposed procedure of modified low temperature bake. For this procedure additional four hours at temperatures around 75°C are implemented before the standard bake at about 120°C. Since the claim is, that cavities treated with such a modified procedure achieve extra-ordinary large accelerating gradients it is a very interesting research field for the European XFEL continuous wave mode upgrade. For this purpose cavities with high quality factors are needed, but in addition large maximal accelerating fields are required to maintain high energies in the pulsed operation mode of the accelerator., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, K.N. Nii, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, We have been carrying out R&D on vertical electropolishing (VEP) technique to establish it as an alternate of the horizontal EP (HEP) technique used for the surface treatment of niobium (Nb) superconducting RF (SRF) cavities. We have earlier reported on a VEP parameter study for 1.3 GHz single and nine-cell Nb cavities. The optimized VEP parameters and a unique rotating cathode yielded uniform removal and a smooth surface in the single cell cavity. The unique cathode and a dual flow mechanism for acid circulation were applied to improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. The vertically electropolished single and nine cell cavities achieved the same RF performance as achieved after the HEP processes. We are making efforts to further improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. Here, we report on a VEP of the 1.3 GHz Nb nine-cell cavity at a higher cathode rotation speed of 50 rpm. The VEP results reveal that the speed could be considered for improving the uniformity in removal while maintaining the surface smoothness.

The VEP process usually results in non-uniform removal with a large asymmetry along the cavity length. In order to suppress the asymmetry in removal, we are making different approaches. Flipping of the cavity during the VEP process is one of the approaches applied so far. A unique VEP setup, which allows the flipping of a multi-cell cavity, has been developed as reported earlier.

There will be two main points this time. The first is that by using our improved Ninja Electrode Premium, we can out-perform our number one and number two competitors in terms of uniform electropolishing of the interior of the 9-cell cavity. The second point is that we can remove hydrogen gas, reacted during electropolishing, from the cavity chambers in a manner that has not been successfully achieved by 1st report, May 2018 and 2nd report, September 2018. We will report our 9-cell vertical polishing revolver-type unit that solves the above two problems., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, While the basic process of electropolishing niobium with 1:9 HF:H2SO4 electrolyte has been well characterized, the specific process parameters used to electropolish different superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity geometries requires thoughtful attention. One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization.

These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure.

In-situ low temper-ature baking of cavity cutouts reveals a dissociation of these room temperature nano-hydrides, which could ex-plain the higher performance of cavities subject to similar in-situ heating in the dewar., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, D. Bafia, J. Zasadzinski, IIT, Chicago, Illinois, USA, D. Bafia, D.J. Bice, A. Grassellino, O.S. Melnychuk, A.S. Romanenko, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, X. Liu, Z. Gao, Y. He, G. Huang, IMP/CAS, Lanzhou, People’s Republic of China, ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, P. Berrutti, I.V. Gonin, T.N. Khabiboulline, M. Parise, D. Passarelli, G.V. Romanov, F. Ruiu, A.I. Sukhanov, V.P. Yakovlev, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, Superconducting SSR2 spoke cavities provide acceleration of the H− in PIP II SRF linac from 35 to 185 MeV. The RF and mechanical design of the SSR2 cavities has been completed and satisfies the technical requirements. However, our resent results of the high RF power tests of fully dressed SSR1 cavities show considerably strong multipacting (MP), which took significant time to process. On the other hand, the new results of the tests of balloon cavity showed significant mitigation of MP. In this paper we present the results of the improved design of the SSR2 cavity, based on the balloon cavity concept. The electromagnetic design is presented, including RF parameter optimization, MP simulations, field asymmetry analysis, High Order Mode (HOM) calculations. Mechanical analysis of the dressed cavity is presented also, which includes Lorentz Force Detuning optimization, and reduction of the cavity resonance frequency sensitivity versus He pressure fluctuations. The design completely satisfies the PIP II technical requirements., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS

Radial deformation of cavity cells can be provided by a special chain or a rolling device with three rollers. The chain distributes the radial forces on the equator area around the cell. The rollers are moving radially in relation to the rotating cavity and provide an equator diameter reduction. Both devices have the contour close to the cell shape at the equator area. The required equator radius deviation depends on the tuning target and usually varies between (0.02…0.60) mm.

The cw-mode operated linac with a final energy of 7.3 MeV/u is intended for various experiments, especially with heavy ions at energies near the coulomb barrier. Currently twelve superconducting CH-cavities are considered which will be split into four different cryostats. Each cavity will be equipped with dynamic bellow tuners. After successful beam tests with CH0 as well as last surface preparations and ongoing rf tests with CH1 and CH2, CH3 to CH11 will be designed. Based on the successful test results, individual optimizations are carried out on the cavity design. Attention was paid to reduce production costs, for example by keeping the cavity diameter in each cryostat constant despite varying particle velocities and gap numbers. In addition to reaching the resonance frequency of 216.816 MHz and the influence of the bellow tuners on the frequency, the mechanical stability of the bellow tuners, the thermal effects on the cavity and the measures to mitigate secondary electron emission are investigated., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, J. Tamura, K. Hasegawa, Y. Kondo, F.M. Maekawa, S.I. Meigo, B. Yee-Rendón, JAEA/J-PARC, Tokai-mura, Japan, E. Kako, T. Konomi, H. Sakai, K. Umemori, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, The Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) is proposing an accelerator-driven subcritical system (ADS) as a future project to transmute long-lived nuclides to short-lived or stable ones. In the JAEA-ADS, a high-power proton beam of 30 MW with a final beam energy of 1.5 GeV is required with a high reliability. Furthermore, the accelerator needs to be operated in a continuous wave mode in order to be compatible with the reactor operation. As the first step toward the detailed design of the JAEA-ADS linac, we are planning to demonstrate a high-field measurement by prototyping a low-beta single spoke resonator (SSR1). We performed the electromagnetic design, and confirmed that the cavity performances of the SSR1 model with and without dimensional constraint., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, IHEP, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, Higher order modes (HOMs) may af{}fect beam stability and refrigeration requirements of superconducting cavity such as the 166.6~MHz superconducting(SC) cavity, which is studied at IHEP. Under certain conditions beam-induced HOMs can accumulate suf{}f{}icient energy to destabilize the beam or quench the SC cavities. In order to limit these ef{}fects, we considers the use of coaxial HOM couplers on the cut-of{}f tubes of the SC cavity. However, HOMs cannot be ef{}fectively extracted by HOM couplers. Therefore, it is necessary to design a HOMs extraction structure to introduce the dangerous modes from the cavity into the bundle tube, which are designed to couple to potentially dangerous modes while suf{}ficiently rejecting the fundamental mode. The HOMs extraction structure consists of an enlarged tubes, a coaxial structure, and the petal. The extraction of the dangerous modes and the suppression of the fundamental mode are realized by the petal structure and the coaxial structure. In order to verify the designs, a rapid prototype for the favored structure was fabricated and characterized on a low-power test-stand., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, X.Y. Zhang, X.R. Hao, D.B. Li, Z.Q. Li, H.Y. Lin, Q. Ma, Z.H. Mi, Q.Y. Wang, P. Zhang, IHEP, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, A 166.6 MHz quarter-wave β=1 superconducting proof-of-principle cavity has been designed and recently been dressed with a helium jacket, fundamental power coupler and tuner. The cavity was subsequently installed in a modified cryomodule and tested in a horizontal manner at both 4.2 K and 2 K. The helium jacket was successfully developed with a focus on minimizing frequency shift due to helium pressure fluctuation while retaining a reasonable tuning range. The Lorentz force detuning (LFD) and microphonics were also optimized during the design. The df/dp and LFD coefficient were measured to be -3.1 Hz/mbar and -0.8 Hz/(MV/m)2. These are in good agreement with simulations. Future work is mainly to reduce the stiffness of the cavity and further suppress the vibration mode of the inner conductor., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, M. Chen, S. Chen, A.Q. Cheng, J.K. Hao, K.X. Liu, Y.Q. Liu, D.M. Ouyang, S.W. Quan, F. Zhu, PKU, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, CIAE, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, BISOL(Beijing Isotope-Separation-On-Line Neutron-Rich Beam Facility) is a new generation radioactive ion beam(RIB) facility[1].

The cavity reached to 35 MV/m with Q0 = 2.0×10zEhNZeHn at 2.0 K, record performance on the cavity made from medium purity ingot niobium. The cavity was cool down with different temperature gradient along the cavity axis in order to understand the flux expulsion mechanism when the cavity does through the superconducting transition and effect of trap residual magnetic field on the residual resistance. The measurement showed the excellent flux expulsion with the flux trapping sensitivity of 0.29 nΩ/mG for electro polished surface and 0.44 nΩ/mG for cavity followed by low temperature baking at 120°C for 12 hours., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, RIKEN Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science, Wako, Saitama, Japan, O. Kamigaito, N. Sakamoto, T. Watanabe, Y. Watanabe, K. Yamada, RIKEN Nishina Center, Wako, Japan, SHI Accelerator Service Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, Upgrades of the RIKEN heavy-ion linac (RILAC) involving a new superconducting linac (SRILAC) are undergoing to promote super-heavy element searches at the RIKEN radioactive isotope beam factory (RIBF). Stable ultra-high vacuum (<10-8 Pa) and particulate-free conditions are strictly necessary for keeping the performance of the superconductive radio frequency (SRF) cavities of the SRILAC. It is crucially important to develop neighboring warm sections to prevent contamination from the existing old RILAC and beamlines built almost four decades ago. In the present study, non-evaporative getter-based differential pumping systems were newly developed to achieve the pressure reduction from the existing beamline vacuum (10-5–10-6 Pa ) to the ultra-high vacuum within very limited length (<80 cm) ensuring the large beam aperture of more than 40 mm. They are also equipped with compact electrostatic particle removers. We will describe and discuss details of the design, construction and performance of the system., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, M. Parise, D. Passarelli, F. Ruiu, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, P. Duchesne, D. Longuevergne, D. Reynet, Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS/IN2P3, IJCLab, Orsay, France, A total of 35 Superconducting SSR2 spoke cavities will be installed in the PIP II SRF linac at Fermilab and a total of 8 prototype SSR2 cavities will be manufactured for the prototype cryomodule. In this paper, the mechanical design and fabrication aspects of the prototype jacketed SSR2 cavity will be presented. RF and mechanical design activities were conducted in parallel directly on the jacketed cavity in order to minimize the number of design iterations. Also, the lessons learned from other spoke cavities experiences (i.e. SSR1 at Fermilab and ESS double spoke at IPNO) were considered since the early stage of the design., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, S.V. Kutsaev, R.B. Agustsson, P.R. Carriere, A. Moro, A.Yu. Smirnov, K.V. Taletski, RadiaBeam, Santa Monica, California, USA, A.N. Cleland, É. Dumur, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA, ANL, Lemont, Illinois, USA, MEPhI, Moscow, Russia, Quantum computers (QC), if realized, could disrupt many computationally intense fields of science. The building block element of a QC is a quantum bit (qubit). Qubits enable the use of quantum superposition and multi-state entanglement in QC calculations, allowing a QC to simultaneously calculate millions of computations at once. However, quantum states stored in a qubit degrade with decreased quality factors and interactions with the environment. One technical solution to improve qubit lifetimes and network interactions is a circuit comprised of a Josephson junction located inside of a high Q-factor superconducting 3D cavity. RadiaBeam, in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory and The University of Chicago, has developed a superconducting radio-frequency quarter-wave resonant cavity (QWR) for quantum computation. Here a 6 GHz QWR was optimized to include tapering of the inner and outer conductors, a toroidal shape for the resonator shorting plane, and the inner conductor to reduce parasitic capacitance. In this paper, we present the results of the qubit cavity design optimization, fabrication, processing and testing in a single-photon regime at mK temperatures., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, T. Reid, Z.A. Conway, B.M. Guilfoyle, M. Kedzie, M.P. Kelly, M.K. Ng, ANL, Lemont, Illinois, USA, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) has extended high quality cavity processing techniques based on those developed for the International Linear Collider to several more complex superconducting RF cavities. Recently, these include a bunch lengthening harmonic cavity, a crabbing rf-dipole cavity, a compact half-wave cavity, and both medium and high frequency elliptical cavities. These systems are an improved version of the one originally developed for 1.3 GHz 9-cell cavities and include a second rotating electrical contact that can support multiple cathodes, necessary for optimum polishing in difficult cavity geometries.

This furnace is currently used for interstitial hydrogen removal (10h00 @ 650 °C) of two type of cavities: 1) the whole series of 26 ESS 352 MHz spoke resonators equipped with their Ti LHe tank well, 2) some prototypes of ESS high beta and medium beta cavities. Up to know IPN Orsay VH2T2 (10h00 @ 650 °C) was successfully applied to more than 16 cavities. In this paper we will first report about these VH2T2 tests. Finally, we have just started testing nitrogen infusion and nitrogen doping processes on samples and 1.3 GHz cavities: the preliminary results will be discussed., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, L. Steder, D. Reschke, DESY, Hamburg, Germany, DESY is and was very active in R&D related to SRF cavities. Many single and nine cell cavities with different surface treatment histories were tested vertically. Results of these cold tests are accelerating gradient and quality factor of the cavities. Using the large number of available datasets the parameters of the 120°C bake procedure, which is applied to avoid high-field Q-slope, are analysed. The impact of different durations and temperatures on accelerating gradient, quality factor and residual resistance is studied in detail and is compared to results obtained with the recently proposed procedure of modified low temperature bake. For this procedure additional four hours at temperatures around 75°C are implemented before the standard bake at about 120°C. Since the claim is, that cavities treated with such a modified procedure achieve extra-ordinary large accelerating gradients it is a very interesting research field for the European XFEL continuous wave mode upgrade. For this purpose cavities with high quality factors are needed, but in addition large maximal accelerating fields are required to maintain high energies in the pulsed operation mode of the accelerator., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, K.N. Nii, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, We have been carrying out R&D on vertical electropolishing (VEP) technique to establish it as an alternate of the horizontal EP (HEP) technique used for the surface treatment of niobium (Nb) superconducting RF (SRF) cavities. We have earlier reported on a VEP parameter study for 1.3 GHz single and nine-cell Nb cavities. The optimized VEP parameters and a unique rotating cathode yielded uniform removal and a smooth surface in the single cell cavity. The unique cathode and a dual flow mechanism for acid circulation were applied to improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. The vertically electropolished single and nine cell cavities achieved the same RF performance as achieved after the HEP processes. We are making efforts to further improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. Here, we report on a VEP of the 1.3 GHz Nb nine-cell cavity at a higher cathode rotation speed of 50 rpm. The VEP results reveal that the speed could be considered for improving the uniformity in removal while maintaining the surface smoothness. Required improvements in the VEP facility and acid flow condition for achieving uniform EP and a smooth surface are also described., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, F. Furuta, D.J. Bicepresenter, A.C. Crawford, T.J. Ring, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, Electro-chemical Polishing (EP) is one of the key technologies of surface treatments for niobium superconducting cavities. We have established a single-cell scale horizontal electro-polishing facility at Fermilab and routinely processed the niobium cavities with the frequencies of 1.3 GHz to 3.9 GHz. The precise control of EP parameters, especially the temperatures of cavity outside wall, allows the uniform removal over the cell with the variation of ±15%.

Indeed, the mechanical polishing is fun-damental also in the superconducting thin film resonant cavities in which one of the main issues that limits the per-formances is the surface preparation. A promising vi-bro-tumbling technique is being studied and implemented with a possibility to replace or improve mechanical treat-ment steps (grinding, barrel polishing). The simplic-ity of the technology allows it to adapt to any cavity geom-etry, both for Nb and Cu materials. The presented work contains last results on 6 GHz cavities obtained at LNL-INFN, both Nb bulk and Cu cavities., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, K.N. Nii, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, Marui Galvanizing Co., Ltd. has been developing vertical electropolishing (VEP) technology for single and nine-cell niobium superconducting radio frequency cavities using a unique cathode namely Ninja cathode in collaboration with KEK. The VEP process usually results in non-uniform removal with a large asymmetry along the cavity length. In order to suppress the asymmetry in removal, we are making different approaches. Flipping of the cavity during the VEP process is one of the approaches applied so far. A unique VEP setup, which allows the flipping of a multi-cell cavity, has been developed as reported earlier. Here, we report the improvement in the setup with automation for cavity flipping. VEP experiments were conducted with the improved system. VEP parameters were studied and the VEP results including the removal trend are discussed in detail., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Y.I. Ida, V. Chouhan, K.N. Niipresenter, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, T. Akabori, G. Mitoya, K. Miyano, HKK, Morioka, Japan, Y. Anetai, F. Takahashi, WING. Co.Ltd, Iwate-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, M. Sawabe, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, The 1st report was delivered in May, 2018 at the IPAC 18 in Vancouver, Canada. The 2nd report was delivered in September, 2018 at the LINAC 18 in Beijing, China. We will make our 3rd report in July, 2019 at the SRF-19 in Dresden, Germany. There will be two main points this time. The first is that by using our improved Ninja Electrode Premium, we can out-perform our number one and number two competitors in terms of uniform electropolishing of the interior of the 9-cell cavity. The second point is that we can remove hydrogen gas, reacted during electropolishing, from the cavity chambers in a manner that has not been successfully achieved by 1st report, May 2018 and 2nd report, September 2018. We will report our 9-cell vertical polishing revolver-type unit that solves the above two problems., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, While the basic process of electropolishing niobium with 1:9 HF:H2SO4 electrolyte has been well characterized, the specific process parameters used to electropolish different superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity geometries requires thoughtful attention. One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization. In preparation for SNS PPU project, JLab performed some EP process development runs with SNS high beta cavities to help identify viable parameter regimes for communication to cavity vendors.

Developing the methods and tools for collecting and characterizing particles found in an accelerator enables process development towards field emission free SRF cavities. Methods are presented for sampling assemblies, components, processes, and environmental conditions utilizing forensic techniques with specialized tooling. Sampling activities to date have produced an inventory of over 850 GSR spindles. Traditional SEM + EDS analysis of this volume of spindles is challenged by labor investment, spindle sampling methods, and the subsequent data pipeline which ultimately results in a statically inadequate dataset for any particulate distribution characterization. A complete systematic analysis of the spindles is enabled by third party software controlling SEM automation for EDS data acquisition.

An R&D program has started at DESY, to prepare for a CW upgrade. Cryomodules are being tested in CW mode in our CryoModule Test Bench (CMTB) to study the performance and main issues for such an operation mode. Sensitivity to vibration causing microphonics is one of the main concerns for the CW operation in mode. Therefore a detailed analysis is being performed to evaluate the frequency spectrum of the EXFEL cryomodule main components: the cavity itself, the cavity string, the cold mass and the vacuum vessel.

The cavities have design loaded-Q of 4×107, which means that it has a control bandwidth of 16 Hz. The JLab prototype cryomodule was instrumented with a series of seven accelerometers, and impulse hammer response measurements were made while the cryomodule was being built and after it was installed in the JLab cryomodule test facility. This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz.

These modules are based on the ELBE modules of the Helmholtz Center Dresden-Rossendorf but are modified to suit the high current and energy-recovering operation at MESA. The energy gain per module per turn should be 25 MeV, provided by two TESLA cavities, which were vertically tested at DESY, Hamburg, Germany. These tests showed an excellent performance of the quench limit and quality factor for three out of the four cavities. The fourth cavity has a lower but still acceptable quench limit and quality factor. In order to validate the performance of the fully assembled cryomodules after delivery to Mainz a test stand has been set up at the Helmholtz Institut Mainz. The test stand is described in detail and the status of the module testing is reported., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, O. Kamigaito, K. Ozeki, N. Sakamoto, K. Suda, K. Yamada, RIKEN Nishina Center, Wako, Japan, Mechanical vibration of quarter-wavelength resonators of SRILAC, the superconducting booster of the RIKEN heavy-ion linac, was measured during a vertical cold test. The measurements were performed for fully assembled cavities as well as for bare niobium cavities without the titanium jacket. In the procedure, the instantaneous resonant frequencies were measured for 10 seconds at a time interval of 1 ms and were recorded as a time series. The frequencies were analyzed by means of conventional signal analysis. The power spectrum was deduced from the autocorrelation function calculated with the fluctuation of resonant frequencies. Although the vibration amplitudes were smaller in the cavities assembled with the titanium jacket, we could not find a clear reason for this., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Ab-initio Study of Atomic Scale Interaction Among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O, A.B. Tesfamichael, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, We employed a combination of ab-initio calculations and statistical mechanical models to understand the nature of atomic scale interaction among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O. Because of the profound nature of the interaction, we began our study by focusing only on the interaction of Nb with Sn in the absence of Cl and O. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we calculated: (1), binding energy of both vacant and interstitial of the super cell for both Nb and Sn atoms (2), rate of diffusion and re-evaporation upon transportation of Sn atom across z-axis from bulk Nb layer (3), electron transfer and electric field upon transportation of Sn atom both across z-axis and xy-plane from bulk Nb layer. Our calculation indicated 30-40% difference from experimental results.

We also calculate matrix elements for electron-impurity scattering in Nb for common impurities O, N, C, and H. By transforming these matrix elements into a Wannier function basis, we calculate lifetimes for a dense set of states on the Fermi surface and determine the mean free path as a function of impurity density.

Here we report extensive numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under the strong rf magnetic field. The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force. We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases, Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities.

In the JAEA-ADS, a high-power proton beam of 30 MW with a final beam energy of 1.5 GeV is required with a high reliability. Furthermore, the accelerator needs to be operated in a continuous wave mode in order to be compatible with the reactor operation. As the first step toward the detailed design of the JAEA-ADS linac, we are planning to demonstrate a high-field measurement by prototyping a low-beta single spoke resonator (SSR1). We performed the electromagnetic design, and confirmed that the cavity performances of the SSR1 model with and without dimensional constraint., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, IHEP, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, Higher order modes (HOMs) may af{}fect beam stability and refrigeration requirements of superconducting cavity such as the 166.6~MHz superconducting(SC) cavity, which is studied at IHEP. Under certain conditions beam-induced HOMs can accumulate suf{}f{}icient energy to destabilize the beam or quench the SC cavities. In order to limit these ef{}fects, we considers the use of coaxial HOM couplers on the cut-of{}f tubes of the SC cavity. However, HOMs cannot be ef{}fectively extracted by HOM couplers. Therefore, it is necessary to design a HOMs extraction structure to introduce the dangerous modes from the cavity into the bundle tube, which are designed to couple to potentially dangerous modes while suf{}ficiently rejecting the fundamental mode. The HOMs extraction structure consists of an enlarged tubes, a coaxial structure, and the petal. The extraction of the dangerous modes and the suppression of the fundamental mode are realized by the petal structure and the coaxial structure. In order to verify the designs, a rapid prototype for the favored structure was fabricated and characterized on a low-power test-stand., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, X.Y. Zhang, X.R. Hao, D.B. Li, Z.Q. Li, H.Y. Lin, Q. Ma, Z.H. Mi, Q.Y. Wang, P. Zhang, IHEP, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, A 166.6 MHz quarter-wave β=1 superconducting proof-of-principle cavity has been designed and recently been dressed with a helium jacket, fundamental power coupler and tuner. The cavity was subsequently installed in a modified cryomodule and tested in a horizontal manner at both 4.2 K and 2 K. The helium jacket was successfully developed with a focus on minimizing frequency shift due to helium pressure fluctuation while retaining a reasonable tuning range. The Lorentz force detuning (LFD) and microphonics were also optimized during the design. The df/dp and LFD coefficient were measured to be -3.1 Hz/mbar and -0.8 Hz/(MV/m)2. These are in good agreement with simulations.

It is crucially important to develop neighboring warm sections to prevent contamination from the existing old RILAC and beamlines built almost four decades ago. In the present study, non-evaporative getter-based differential pumping systems were newly developed to achieve the pressure reduction from the existing beamline vacuum (10-5–10-6 Pa ) to the ultra-high vacuum within very limited length (<80 cm) ensuring the large beam aperture of more than 40 mm.

Qubits enable the use of quantum superposition and multi-state entanglement in QC calculations, allowing a QC to simultaneously calculate millions of computations at once. However, quantum states stored in a qubit degrade with decreased quality factors and interactions with the environment. One technical solution to improve qubit lifetimes and network interactions is a circuit comprised of a Josephson junction located inside of a high Q-factor superconducting 3D cavity.

Many single and nine cell cavities with different surface treatment histories were tested vertically. Results of these cold tests are accelerating gradient and quality factor of the cavities. Using the large number of available datasets the parameters of the 120°C bake procedure, which is applied to avoid high-field Q-slope, are analysed. The impact of different durations and temperatures on accelerating gradient, quality factor and residual resistance is studied in detail and is compared to results obtained with the recently proposed procedure of modified low temperature bake. For this procedure additional four hours at temperatures around 75°C are implemented before the standard bake at about 120°C. Since the claim is, that cavities treated with such a modified procedure achieve extra-ordinary large accelerating gradients it is a very interesting research field for the European XFEL continuous wave mode upgrade.

We have earlier reported on a VEP parameter study for 1.3 GHz single and nine-cell Nb cavities. The optimized VEP parameters and a unique rotating cathode yielded uniform removal and a smooth surface in the single cell cavity. The unique cathode and a dual flow mechanism for acid circulation were applied to improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. The vertically electropolished single and nine cell cavities achieved the same RF performance as achieved after the HEP processes. We are making efforts to further improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. Here, we report on a VEP of the 1.3 GHz Nb nine-cell cavity at a higher cathode rotation speed of 50 rpm. The VEP results reveal that the speed could be considered for improving the uniformity in removal while maintaining the surface smoothness.

One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior.

A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure.

   Title: HOMs Extraction Structure Design for HEPS 166.6 MHz Cavities
   Authors: IHEP, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, Higher order modes (HOMs) may af{}fect beam stability and refrigeration requirements of superconducting cavity such as the 166.6~MHz superconducting(SC) cavity, which is studied at IHEP. Under certain conditions beam-induced HOMs can accumulate suf{}f{}icient energy to destabilize the beam or quench the SC cavities. In order to limit these ef{}fects, we considers the use of coaxial HOM couplers on the cut-of{}f tubes of the SC cavity. However, HOMs cannot be ef{}fectively extracted by HOM couplers. Therefore, it is necessary to design a HOMs extraction structure to introduce the dangerous modes from the cavity into the bundle tube, which are designed to couple to potentially dangerous modes while suf{}ficiently rejecting the fundamental mode. The HOMs extraction structure consists of an enlarged tubes, a coaxial structure, and the petal. The extraction of the dangerous modes and the suppression of the fundamental mode are realized by the petal structure and the coaxial structure. In order to verify the designs, a rapid prototype for the favored structure was fabricated and characterized on a low-power test-stand., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, X.Y. Zhang, X.R. Hao, D.B. Li, Z.Q. Li, H.Y. Lin, Q. Ma, Z.H. Mi, Q.Y. Wang, P. Zhang, IHEP, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, A 166.6 MHz quarter-wave β=1 superconducting proof-of-principle cavity has been designed and recently been dressed with a helium jacket, fundamental power coupler and tuner. The cavity was subsequently installed in a modified cryomodule and tested in a horizontal manner at both 4.2 K and 2 K. The helium jacket was successfully developed with a focus on minimizing frequency shift due to helium pressure fluctuation while retaining a reasonable tuning range. The Lorentz force detuning (LFD) and microphonics were also optimized during the design. The df/dp and LFD coefficient were measured to be -3.1 Hz/mbar and -0.8 Hz/(MV/m)2. These are in good agreement with simulations. Future work is mainly to reduce the stiffness of the cavity and further suppress the vibration mode of the inner conductor., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, M. Chen, S. Chen, A.Q. Cheng, J.K. Hao, K.X. Liu, Y.Q. Liu, D.M. Ouyang, S.W. Quan, F. Zhu, PKU, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, CIAE, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, BISOL(Beijing Isotope-Separation-On-Line Neutron-Rich Beam Facility) is a new generation radioactive ion beam(RIB) facility[1]. It consists a CARR nuclear reactor, a high intensity deuteron accelerator and a post accelera-tor. QWR085 cavity is supposed to be used in SCL2 of post accelerator. This paper mainly talks about the elec-tromagnetic design, mechanical design and vibration damper design of QWR085., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, P. Dhakal, G. Ciovati, G.R. Myneni, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, We presented the RF measurement on a 1.3 GHz single cell cavity fabricated at KEK using large grain ingot niobium with RRR=107. The cavity reached to 35 MV/m with Q0 = 2.0×10zEhNZeHn at 2.0 K, record performance on the cavity made from medium purity ingot niobium. The cavity was cool down with different temperature gradient along the cavity axis in order to understand the flux expulsion mechanism when the cavity does through the superconducting transition and effect of trap residual magnetic field on the residual resistance. The measurement showed the excellent flux expulsion with the flux trapping sensitivity of 0.29 nΩ/mG for electro polished surface and 0.44 nΩ/mG for cavity followed by low temperature baking at 120°C for 12 hours., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, RIKEN Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science, Wako, Saitama, Japan, O. Kamigaito, N. Sakamoto, T. Watanabe, Y. Watanabe, K. Yamada, RIKEN Nishina Center, Wako, Japan, SHI Accelerator Service Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, Upgrades of the RIKEN heavy-ion linac (RILAC) involving a new superconducting linac (SRILAC) are undergoing to promote super-heavy element searches at the RIKEN radioactive isotope beam factory (RIBF). Stable ultra-high vacuum (<10-8 Pa) and particulate-free conditions are strictly necessary for keeping the performance of the superconductive radio frequency (SRF) cavities of the SRILAC. It is crucially important to develop neighboring warm sections to prevent contamination from the existing old RILAC and beamlines built almost four decades ago. In the present study, non-evaporative getter-based differential pumping systems were newly developed to achieve the pressure reduction from the existing beamline vacuum (10-5–10-6 Pa ) to the ultra-high vacuum within very limited length (<80 cm) ensuring the large beam aperture of more than 40 mm. They are also equipped with compact electrostatic particle removers. We will describe and discuss details of the design, construction and performance of the system., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, M. Parise, D. Passarelli, F. Ruiu, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, P. Duchesne, D. Longuevergne, D. Reynet, Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS/IN2P3, IJCLab, Orsay, France, A total of 35 Superconducting SSR2 spoke cavities will be installed in the PIP II SRF linac at Fermilab and a total of 8 prototype SSR2 cavities will be manufactured for the prototype cryomodule. In this paper, the mechanical design and fabrication aspects of the prototype jacketed SSR2 cavity will be presented. RF and mechanical design activities were conducted in parallel directly on the jacketed cavity in order to minimize the number of design iterations. Also, the lessons learned from other spoke cavities experiences (i.e. SSR1 at Fermilab and ESS double spoke at IPNO) were considered since the early stage of the design., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, S.V. Kutsaev, R.B. Agustsson, P.R. Carriere, A. Moro, A.Yu. Smirnov, K.V. Taletski, RadiaBeam, Santa Monica, California, USA, A.N. Cleland, É. Dumur, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA, ANL, Lemont, Illinois, USA, MEPhI, Moscow, Russia, Quantum computers (QC), if realized, could disrupt many computationally intense fields of science. The building block element of a QC is a quantum bit (qubit). Qubits enable the use of quantum superposition and multi-state entanglement in QC calculations, allowing a QC to simultaneously calculate millions of computations at once. However, quantum states stored in a qubit degrade with decreased quality factors and interactions with the environment. One technical solution to improve qubit lifetimes and network interactions is a circuit comprised of a Josephson junction located inside of a high Q-factor superconducting 3D cavity. RadiaBeam, in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory and The University of Chicago, has developed a superconducting radio-frequency quarter-wave resonant cavity (QWR) for quantum computation. Here a 6 GHz QWR was optimized to include tapering of the inner and outer conductors, a toroidal shape for the resonator shorting plane, and the inner conductor to reduce parasitic capacitance. In this paper, we present the results of the qubit cavity design optimization, fabrication, processing and testing in a single-photon regime at mK temperatures., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, T. Reid, Z.A. Conway, B.M. Guilfoyle, M. Kedzie, M.P. Kelly, M.K. Ng, ANL, Lemont, Illinois, USA, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) has extended high quality cavity processing techniques based on those developed for the International Linear Collider to several more complex superconducting RF cavities. Recently, these include a bunch lengthening harmonic cavity, a crabbing rf-dipole cavity, a compact half-wave cavity, and both medium and high frequency elliptical cavities. These systems are an improved version of the one originally developed for 1.3 GHz 9-cell cavities and include a second rotating electrical contact that can support multiple cathodes, necessary for optimum polishing in difficult cavity geometries. All include the possibility for external water cooling., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, M. Fouaidy, F. Chatelet, V. Delpech, F. Galet, D. Le Dréan, R. Martret, G. Olry, T. Pépin-Donat, Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS/IN2P3, IJCLab, Orsay, France, M. Baudrier, P. Carbonnier, E. Fayette, X. Hanus, Th. Proslier, D. Roudier, P. Sahuquet, C. Servouin, CEA-DRF-IRFU, France, E. Cenni, L. Maurice, CEA-IRFU, Gif-sur-Yvette, France, FLUO, Orsay, France, In the framework of ESS, a vacuum furnace dedicated to High Temperature Heat Treatment under Vacuum (VH2T2) of SRF bulk Nb cavities was developed and commissioned in May 2016. This furnace is currently used for interstitial hydrogen removal (10h00 @ 650 °C) of two type of cavities: 1) the whole series of 26 ESS 352 MHz spoke resonators equipped with their Ti LHe tank well, 2) some prototypes of ESS high beta and medium beta cavities. Up to know IPN Orsay VH2T2 (10h00 @ 650 °C) was successfully applied to more than 16 cavities. In this paper we will first report about these VH2T2 tests. Finally, we have just started testing nitrogen infusion and nitrogen doping processes on samples and 1.3 GHz cavities: the preliminary results will be discussed., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, L. Steder, D. Reschke, DESY, Hamburg, Germany, DESY is and was very active in R&D related to SRF cavities. Many single and nine cell cavities with different surface treatment histories were tested vertically. Results of these cold tests are accelerating gradient and quality factor of the cavities. Using the large number of available datasets the parameters of the 120°C bake procedure, which is applied to avoid high-field Q-slope, are analysed. The impact of different durations and temperatures on accelerating gradient, quality factor and residual resistance is studied in detail and is compared to results obtained with the recently proposed procedure of modified low temperature bake. For this procedure additional four hours at temperatures around 75°C are implemented before the standard bake at about 120°C. Since the claim is, that cavities treated with such a modified procedure achieve extra-ordinary large accelerating gradients it is a very interesting research field for the European XFEL continuous wave mode upgrade. For this purpose cavities with high quality factors are needed, but in addition large maximal accelerating fields are required to maintain high energies in the pulsed operation mode of the accelerator., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, K.N. Nii, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, We have been carrying out R&D on vertical electropolishing (VEP) technique to establish it as an alternate of the horizontal EP (HEP) technique used for the surface treatment of niobium (Nb) superconducting RF (SRF) cavities. We have earlier reported on a VEP parameter study for 1.3 GHz single and nine-cell Nb cavities. The optimized VEP parameters and a unique rotating cathode yielded uniform removal and a smooth surface in the single cell cavity. The unique cathode and a dual flow mechanism for acid circulation were applied to improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. The vertically electropolished single and nine cell cavities achieved the same RF performance as achieved after the HEP processes. We are making efforts to further improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. Here, we report on a VEP of the 1.3 GHz Nb nine-cell cavity at a higher cathode rotation speed of 50 rpm. The VEP results reveal that the speed could be considered for improving the uniformity in removal while maintaining the surface smoothness. Required improvements in the VEP facility and acid flow condition for achieving uniform EP and a smooth surface are also described., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, F. Furuta, D.J. Bicepresenter, A.C. Crawford, T.J. Ring, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, Electro-chemical Polishing (EP) is one of the key technologies of surface treatments for niobium superconducting cavities. We have established a single-cell scale horizontal electro-polishing facility at Fermilab and routinely processed the niobium cavities with the frequencies of 1.3 GHz to 3.9 GHz. The precise control of EP parameters, especially the temperatures of cavity outside wall, allows the uniform removal over the cell with the variation of ±15%.

Indeed, the mechanical polishing is fun-damental also in the superconducting thin film resonant cavities in which one of the main issues that limits the per-formances is the surface preparation. A promising vi-bro-tumbling technique is being studied and implemented with a possibility to replace or improve mechanical treat-ment steps (grinding, barrel polishing). The simplic-ity of the technology allows it to adapt to any cavity geom-etry, both for Nb and Cu materials. The presented work contains last results on 6 GHz cavities obtained at LNL-INFN, both Nb bulk and Cu cavities., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, K.N. Nii, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, Marui Galvanizing Co., Ltd. has been developing vertical electropolishing (VEP) technology for single and nine-cell niobium superconducting radio frequency cavities using a unique cathode namely Ninja cathode in collaboration with KEK. The VEP process usually results in non-uniform removal with a large asymmetry along the cavity length. In order to suppress the asymmetry in removal, we are making different approaches. Flipping of the cavity during the VEP process is one of the approaches applied so far. A unique VEP setup, which allows the flipping of a multi-cell cavity, has been developed as reported earlier. Here, we report the improvement in the setup with automation for cavity flipping. VEP experiments were conducted with the improved system. VEP parameters were studied and the VEP results including the removal trend are discussed in detail., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Y.I. Ida, V. Chouhan, K.N. Niipresenter, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, T. Akabori, G. Mitoya, K. Miyano, HKK, Morioka, Japan, Y. Anetai, F. Takahashi, WING. Co.Ltd, Iwate-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, M. Sawabe, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, The 1st report was delivered in May, 2018 at the IPAC 18 in Vancouver, Canada. The 2nd report was delivered in September, 2018 at the LINAC 18 in Beijing, China. We will make our 3rd report in July, 2019 at the SRF-19 in Dresden, Germany. There will be two main points this time. The first is that by using our improved Ninja Electrode Premium, we can out-perform our number one and number two competitors in terms of uniform electropolishing of the interior of the 9-cell cavity. The second point is that we can remove hydrogen gas, reacted during electropolishing, from the cavity chambers in a manner that has not been successfully achieved by 1st report, May 2018 and 2nd report, September 2018. We will report our 9-cell vertical polishing revolver-type unit that solves the above two problems., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, While the basic process of electropolishing niobium with 1:9 HF:H2SO4 electrolyte has been well characterized, the specific process parameters used to electropolish different superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity geometries requires thoughtful attention. One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization. In preparation for SNS PPU project, JLab performed some EP process development runs with SNS high beta cavities to help identify viable parameter regimes for communication to cavity vendors.

Developing the methods and tools for collecting and characterizing particles found in an accelerator enables process development towards field emission free SRF cavities. Methods are presented for sampling assemblies, components, processes, and environmental conditions utilizing forensic techniques with specialized tooling. Sampling activities to date have produced an inventory of over 850 GSR spindles. Traditional SEM + EDS analysis of this volume of spindles is challenged by labor investment, spindle sampling methods, and the subsequent data pipeline which ultimately results in a statically inadequate dataset for any particulate distribution characterization. A complete systematic analysis of the spindles is enabled by third party software controlling SEM automation for EDS data acquisition.

An R&D program has started at DESY, to prepare for a CW upgrade. Cryomodules are being tested in CW mode in our CryoModule Test Bench (CMTB) to study the performance and main issues for such an operation mode. Sensitivity to vibration causing microphonics is one of the main concerns for the CW operation in mode. Therefore a detailed analysis is being performed to evaluate the frequency spectrum of the EXFEL cryomodule main components: the cavity itself, the cavity string, the cold mass and the vacuum vessel. Finite Element Modal Analyses have been performed and the results compared with data measured at the CMTB.

The cavities have design loaded-Q of 4×107, which means that it has a control bandwidth of 16 Hz. The JLab prototype cryomodule was instrumented with a series of seven accelerometers, and impulse hammer response measurements were made while the cryomodule was being built and after it was installed in the JLab cryomodule test facility. This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz.

Because of the profound nature of the interaction, we began our study by focusing only on the interaction of Nb with Sn in the absence of Cl and O. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we calculated: (1), binding energy of both vacant and interstitial of the super cell for both Nb and Sn atoms (2), rate of diffusion and re-evaporation upon transportation of Sn atom across z-axis from bulk Nb layer (3), electron transfer and electric field upon transportation of Sn atom both across z-axis and xy-plane from bulk Nb layer.

Several models and experimental studies have been proposed and performed over the years to understand the origin of these anomalous losses but a general consensus on what these orgins are is yet to be established. In this contribution, we present the results from the RF tests of several 1.3 GHz single-cell cavities limited by the HFQS and tested using a variable input coupler. This allowed to maintain close to critical coupling even at high field and the data showed that the HFQS did not saturate and that in some cases a power dissipation of up to 200 W at 2 K could be sustained without quench., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, G. Ciovati, G. Cheng, E. Daly, G.V. Eremeev, J. Henry, R.A. Rimmer, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, ODU, Norfolk, Virginia, USA, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia, USA, Industrial application of SRF technology would favor the use of cryocoolers to conductively cool SRF cavities for particle accelerators, operating at or above 4.3 K. In order to achieve a lower surface resistance than Nb at 4.3 K, a superconductor with higher critical temperature should be used, whereas a metal with higher thermal conductivity than Nb should be used to conduct the heat to the cryocoolers. A standard 1.5 GHz bulk Nb single-cell cavity has been coated with a ~2 µm thick layer of Nb3Sn on the inner surface and with a 5 mm thick Cu layer on the outer surface for conduction cooled applications. The cavity performance has been measured at 4.3 K and 2.0 K in liquid He. The cavity reached a peak surface magnetic field of ~40 mT with a quality factor of 6×109 and 3.5×109 at 4.3 K, before and after applying the thick Cu layer, respectively., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, J.T. Maniscalco, T. Gruber, A.T. Holic, M. Liepe, Cornell University (CLASSE), Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education, Ithaca, New York, USA, The Cornell DC Field Dependence Cavity is a new coaxial test resonator designed to study the impact of strong (up to 200 mT or more) DC surface magnetic fields on the superconducting surface resistance, providing physical insight into the root of the ‘‘anti-Q-slope’’ and probing critical fields.

Here we report extensive numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under the strong rf magnetic field. The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force. We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases, Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities. The original production material came from Two vendors Tokyo Denkai Co., Ltd. (TD) and Ningxia Orient Tantalum Industry Co., Ltd. (OTIC/NX)). It was found TD niobium required a lower annealing temperature (900°C) to obtain satisfactory flux expulsion characteristics compared to NX which required a slightly higher annealing temperature (950°-975°C). In order to ensure the new TD material performed equivalent to the niobium produced 4 year before after 900°C annealing; each heat lot of niobium had its flux expulsion characteristics parametrized and custom thermal treatments developed for each lot.

The cavity was subsequently installed in a modified cryomodule and tested in a horizontal manner at both 4.2 K and 2 K. The helium jacket was successfully developed with a focus on minimizing frequency shift due to helium pressure fluctuation while retaining a reasonable tuning range. The Lorentz force detuning (LFD) and microphonics were also optimized during the design. The df/dp and LFD coefficient were measured to be -3.1 Hz/mbar and -0.8 Hz/(MV/m)2. These are in good agreement with simulations. Future work is mainly to reduce the stiffness of the cavity and further suppress the vibration mode of the inner conductor., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, M. Chen, S. Chen, A.Q. Cheng, J.K. Hao, K.X. Liu, Y.Q. Liu, D.M. Ouyang, S.W. Quan, F. Zhu, PKU, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, CIAE, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, BISOL(Beijing Isotope-Separation-On-Line Neutron-Rich Beam Facility) is a new generation radioactive ion beam(RIB) facility[1].

The cavity reached to 35 MV/m with Q0 = 2.0×10zEhNZeHn at 2.0 K, record performance on the cavity made from medium purity ingot niobium. The cavity was cool down with different temperature gradient along the cavity axis in order to understand the flux expulsion mechanism when the cavity does through the superconducting transition and effect of trap residual magnetic field on the residual resistance. The measurement showed the excellent flux expulsion with the flux trapping sensitivity of 0.29 nΩ/mG for electro polished surface and 0.44 nΩ/mG for cavity followed by low temperature baking at 120°C for 12 hours., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, RIKEN Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science, Wako, Saitama, Japan, O. Kamigaito, N. Sakamoto, T. Watanabe, Y. Watanabe, K. Yamada, RIKEN Nishina Center, Wako, Japan, SHI Accelerator Service Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, Upgrades of the RIKEN heavy-ion linac (RILAC) involving a new superconducting linac (SRILAC) are undergoing to promote super-heavy element searches at the RIKEN radioactive isotope beam factory (RIBF). Stable ultra-high vacuum (<10-8 Pa) and particulate-free conditions are strictly necessary for keeping the performance of the superconductive radio frequency (SRF) cavities of the SRILAC. It is crucially important to develop neighboring warm sections to prevent contamination from the existing old RILAC and beamlines built almost four decades ago. In the present study, non-evaporative getter-based differential pumping systems were newly developed to achieve the pressure reduction from the existing beamline vacuum (10-5–10-6 Pa ) to the ultra-high vacuum within very limited length (<80 cm) ensuring the large beam aperture of more than 40 mm. They are also equipped with compact electrostatic particle removers.

RF and mechanical design activities were conducted in parallel directly on the jacketed cavity in order to minimize the number of design iterations. Also, the lessons learned from other spoke cavities experiences (i.e. SSR1 at Fermilab and ESS double spoke at IPNO) were considered since the early stage of the design., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, S.V. Kutsaev, R.B. Agustsson, P.R. Carriere, A. Moro, A.Yu. Smirnov, K.V. Taletski, RadiaBeam, Santa Monica, California, USA, A.N. Cleland, É. Dumur, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA, ANL, Lemont, Illinois, USA, MEPhI, Moscow, Russia, Quantum computers (QC), if realized, could disrupt many computationally intense fields of science. The building block element of a QC is a quantum bit (qubit). Qubits enable the use of quantum superposition and multi-state entanglement in QC calculations, allowing a QC to simultaneously calculate millions of computations at once. However, quantum states stored in a qubit degrade with decreased quality factors and interactions with the environment. One technical solution to improve qubit lifetimes and network interactions is a circuit comprised of a Josephson junction located inside of a high Q-factor superconducting 3D cavity. RadiaBeam, in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory and The University of Chicago, has developed a superconducting radio-frequency quarter-wave resonant cavity (QWR) for quantum computation. Here a 6 GHz QWR was optimized to include tapering of the inner and outer conductors, a toroidal shape for the resonator shorting plane, and the inner conductor to reduce parasitic capacitance.

This furnace is currently used for interstitial hydrogen removal (10h00 @ 650 °C) of two type of cavities: 1) the whole series of 26 ESS 352 MHz spoke resonators equipped with their Ti LHe tank well, 2) some prototypes of ESS high beta and medium beta cavities. Up to know IPN Orsay VH2T2 (10h00 @ 650 °C) was successfully applied to more than 16 cavities. In this paper we will first report about these VH2T2 tests.

Many single and nine cell cavities with different surface treatment histories were tested vertically. Results of these cold tests are accelerating gradient and quality factor of the cavities. Using the large number of available datasets the parameters of the 120°C bake procedure, which is applied to avoid high-field Q-slope, are analysed. The impact of different durations and temperatures on accelerating gradient, quality factor and residual resistance is studied in detail and is compared to results obtained with the recently proposed procedure of modified low temperature bake. For this procedure additional four hours at temperatures around 75°C are implemented before the standard bake at about 120°C. Since the claim is, that cavities treated with such a modified procedure achieve extra-ordinary large accelerating gradients it is a very interesting research field for the European XFEL continuous wave mode upgrade. For this purpose cavities with high quality factors are needed, but in addition large maximal accelerating fields are required to maintain high energies in the pulsed operation mode of the accelerator., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, K.N. Nii, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, We have been carrying out R&D on vertical electropolishing (VEP) technique to establish it as an alternate of the horizontal EP (HEP) technique used for the surface treatment of niobium (Nb) superconducting RF (SRF) cavities. We have earlier reported on a VEP parameter study for 1.3 GHz single and nine-cell Nb cavities. The optimized VEP parameters and a unique rotating cathode yielded uniform removal and a smooth surface in the single cell cavity. The unique cathode and a dual flow mechanism for acid circulation were applied to improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. The vertically electropolished single and nine cell cavities achieved the same RF performance as achieved after the HEP processes. We are making efforts to further improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. Here, we report on a VEP of the 1.3 GHz Nb nine-cell cavity at a higher cathode rotation speed of 50 rpm. The VEP results reveal that the speed could be considered for improving the uniformity in removal while maintaining the surface smoothness.

Indeed, the mechanical polishing is fun-damental also in the superconducting thin film resonant cavities in which one of the main issues that limits the per-formances is the surface preparation. A promising vi-bro-tumbling technique is being studied and implemented with a possibility to replace or improve mechanical treat-ment steps (grinding, barrel polishing). The simplic-ity of the technology allows it to adapt to any cavity geom-etry, both for Nb and Cu materials.

The VEP process usually results in non-uniform removal with a large asymmetry along the cavity length. In order to suppress the asymmetry in removal, we are making different approaches. Flipping of the cavity during the VEP process is one of the approaches applied so far. A unique VEP setup, which allows the flipping of a multi-cell cavity, has been developed as reported earlier. Here, we report the improvement in the setup with automation for cavity flipping. VEP experiments were conducted with the improved system.

The 2nd report was delivered in September, 2018 at the LINAC 18 in Beijing, China. We will make our 3rd report in July, 2019 at the SRF-19 in Dresden, Germany. There will be two main points this time. The first is that by using our improved Ninja Electrode Premium, we can out-perform our number one and number two competitors in terms of uniform electropolishing of the interior of the 9-cell cavity. The second point is that we can remove hydrogen gas, reacted during electropolishing, from the cavity chambers in a manner that has not been successfully achieved by 1st report, May 2018 and 2nd report, September 2018. We will report our 9-cell vertical polishing revolver-type unit that solves the above two problems., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, While the basic process of electropolishing niobium with 1:9 HF:H2SO4 electrolyte has been well characterized, the specific process parameters used to electropolish different superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity geometries requires thoughtful attention. One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization. In preparation for SNS PPU project, JLab performed some EP process development runs with SNS high beta cavities to help identify viable parameter regimes for communication to cavity vendors. Results from this study are presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, J.K. Spradlin, C.E. Reecepresenter, O. Trofimova, A-M. Valente-Feliciano, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, Foreign particles residing on the field carrying surface of accelerator cavities are a known mechanism for field emission. Developing the methods and tools for collecting and characterizing particles found in an accelerator enables process development towards field emission free SRF cavities. Methods are presented for sampling assemblies, components, processes, and environmental conditions utilizing forensic techniques with specialized tooling. Sampling activities to date have produced an inventory of over 850 GSR spindles. Traditional SEM + EDS analysis of this volume of spindles is challenged by labor investment, spindle sampling methods, and the subsequent data pipeline which ultimately results in a statically inadequate dataset for any particulate distribution characterization. A complete systematic analysis of the spindles is enabled by third party software controlling SEM automation for EDS data acquisition.

An R&D program has started at DESY, to prepare for a CW upgrade. Cryomodules are being tested in CW mode in our CryoModule Test Bench (CMTB) to study the performance and main issues for such an operation mode. Sensitivity to vibration causing microphonics is one of the main concerns for the CW operation in mode. Therefore a detailed analysis is being performed to evaluate the frequency spectrum of the EXFEL cryomodule main components: the cavity itself, the cavity string, the cold mass and the vacuum vessel.

The cavities have design loaded-Q of 4×107, which means that it has a control bandwidth of 16 Hz. The JLab prototype cryomodule was instrumented with a series of seven accelerometers, and impulse hammer response measurements were made while the cryomodule was being built and after it was installed in the JLab cryomodule test facility. This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz.

Because of the profound nature of the interaction, we began our study by focusing only on the interaction of Nb with Sn in the absence of Cl and O. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we calculated: (1), binding energy of both vacant and interstitial of the super cell for both Nb and Sn atoms (2), rate of diffusion and re-evaporation upon transportation of Sn atom across z-axis from bulk Nb layer (3), electron transfer and electric field upon transportation of Sn atom both across z-axis and xy-plane from bulk Nb layer.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities.

Stable ultra-high vacuum (<10-8 Pa) and particulate-free conditions are strictly necessary for keeping the performance of the superconductive radio frequency (SRF) cavities of the SRILAC. It is crucially important to develop neighboring warm sections to prevent contamination from the existing old RILAC and beamlines built almost four decades ago. In the present study, non-evaporative getter-based differential pumping systems were newly developed to achieve the pressure reduction from the existing beamline vacuum (10-5–10-6 Pa ) to the ultra-high vacuum within very limited length (<80 cm) ensuring the large beam aperture of more than 40 mm. They are also equipped with compact electrostatic particle removers.

Qubits enable the use of quantum superposition and multi-state entanglement in QC calculations, allowing a QC to simultaneously calculate millions of computations at once. However, quantum states stored in a qubit degrade with decreased quality factors and interactions with the environment.

This furnace is currently used for interstitial hydrogen removal (10h00 @ 650 °C) of two type of cavities: 1) the whole series of 26 ESS 352 MHz spoke resonators equipped with their Ti LHe tank well, 2) some prototypes of ESS high beta and medium beta cavities. Up to know IPN Orsay VH2T2 (10h00 @ 650 °C) was successfully applied to more than 16 cavities. In this paper we will first report about these VH2T2 tests.

Many single and nine cell cavities with different surface treatment histories were tested vertically. Results of these cold tests are accelerating gradient and quality factor of the cavities. Using the large number of available datasets the parameters of the 120°C bake procedure, which is applied to avoid high-field Q-slope, are analysed. The impact of different durations and temperatures on accelerating gradient, quality factor and residual resistance is studied in detail and is compared to results obtained with the recently proposed procedure of modified low temperature bake. For this procedure additional four hours at temperatures around 75°C are implemented before the standard bake at about 120°C. Since the claim is, that cavities treated with such a modified procedure achieve extra-ordinary large accelerating gradients it is a very interesting research field for the European XFEL continuous wave mode upgrade. For this purpose cavities with high quality factors are needed, but in addition large maximal accelerating fields are required to maintain high energies in the pulsed operation mode of the accelerator., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, K.N. Nii, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, We have been carrying out R&D on vertical electropolishing (VEP) technique to establish it as an alternate of the horizontal EP (HEP) technique used for the surface treatment of niobium (Nb) superconducting RF (SRF) cavities. We have earlier reported on a VEP parameter study for 1.3 GHz single and nine-cell Nb cavities. The optimized VEP parameters and a unique rotating cathode yielded uniform removal and a smooth surface in the single cell cavity. The unique cathode and a dual flow mechanism for acid circulation were applied to improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. The vertically electropolished single and nine cell cavities achieved the same RF performance as achieved after the HEP processes. We are making efforts to further improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. Here, we report on a VEP of the 1.3 GHz Nb nine-cell cavity at a higher cathode rotation speed of 50 rpm. The VEP results reveal that the speed could be considered for improving the uniformity in removal while maintaining the surface smoothness.

The VEP process usually results in non-uniform removal with a large asymmetry along the cavity length. In order to suppress the asymmetry in removal, we are making different approaches. Flipping of the cavity during the VEP process is one of the approaches applied so far. A unique VEP setup, which allows the flipping of a multi-cell cavity, has been developed as reported earlier.

There will be two main points this time. The first is that by using our improved Ninja Electrode Premium, we can out-perform our number one and number two competitors in terms of uniform electropolishing of the interior of the 9-cell cavity. The second point is that we can remove hydrogen gas, reacted during electropolishing, from the cavity chambers in a manner that has not been successfully achieved by 1st report, May 2018 and 2nd report, September 2018. We will report our 9-cell vertical polishing revolver-type unit that solves the above two problems., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, While the basic process of electropolishing niobium with 1:9 HF:H2SO4 electrolyte has been well characterized, the specific process parameters used to electropolish different superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity geometries requires thoughtful attention. One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization.

These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure.

In-situ low temper-ature baking of cavity cutouts reveals a dissociation of these room temperature nano-hydrides, which could ex-plain the higher performance of cavities subject to similar in-situ heating in the dewar., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, D. Bafia, J. Zasadzinski, IIT, Chicago, Illinois, USA, D. Bafia, D.J. Bice, A. Grassellino, O.S. Melnychuk, A.S. Romanenko, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, X. Liu, Z. Gao, Y. He, G. Huang, IMP/CAS, Lanzhou, People’s Republic of China, ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, P. Berrutti, I.V. Gonin, T.N. Khabiboulline, M. Parise, D. Passarelli, G.V. Romanov, F. Ruiu, A.I. Sukhanov, V.P. Yakovlev, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, Superconducting SSR2 spoke cavities provide acceleration of the H− in PIP II SRF linac from 35 to 185 MeV. The RF and mechanical design of the SSR2 cavities has been completed and satisfies the technical requirements. However, our resent results of the high RF power tests of fully dressed SSR1 cavities show considerably strong multipacting (MP), which took significant time to process. On the other hand, the new results of the tests of balloon cavity showed significant mitigation of MP. In this paper we present the results of the improved design of the SSR2 cavity, based on the balloon cavity concept. The electromagnetic design is presented, including RF parameter optimization, MP simulations, field asymmetry analysis, High Order Mode (HOM) calculations. Mechanical analysis of the dressed cavity is presented also, which includes Lorentz Force Detuning optimization, and reduction of the cavity resonance frequency sensitivity versus He pressure fluctuations.

Radial deformation of cavity cells can be provided by a special chain or a rolling device with three rollers. The chain distributes the radial forces on the equator area around the cell.

   Title: Evaluation of High Performance Large Grain Medium Purity SRF Cavity From KEK
   Authors: P. Dhakal, G. Ciovati, G.R. Myneni, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, We presented the RF measurement on a 1.3 GHz single cell cavity fabricated at KEK using large grain ingot niobium with RRR=107. The cavity reached to 35 MV/m with Q0 = 2.0×10zEhNZeHn at 2.0 K, record performance on the cavity made from medium purity ingot niobium. The cavity was cool down with different temperature gradient along the cavity axis in order to understand the flux expulsion mechanism when the cavity does through the superconducting transition and effect of trap residual magnetic field on the residual resistance. The measurement showed the excellent flux expulsion with the flux trapping sensitivity of 0.29 nΩ/mG for electro polished surface and 0.44 nΩ/mG for cavity followed by low temperature baking at 120°C for 12 hours., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, RIKEN Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science, Wako, Saitama, Japan, O. Kamigaito, N. Sakamoto, T. Watanabe, Y. Watanabe, K. Yamada, RIKEN Nishina Center, Wako, Japan, SHI Accelerator Service Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, Upgrades of the RIKEN heavy-ion linac (RILAC) involving a new superconducting linac (SRILAC) are undergoing to promote super-heavy element searches at the RIKEN radioactive isotope beam factory (RIBF). Stable ultra-high vacuum (<10-8 Pa) and particulate-free conditions are strictly necessary for keeping the performance of the superconductive radio frequency (SRF) cavities of the SRILAC. It is crucially important to develop neighboring warm sections to prevent contamination from the existing old RILAC and beamlines built almost four decades ago. In the present study, non-evaporative getter-based differential pumping systems were newly developed to achieve the pressure reduction from the existing beamline vacuum (10-5–10-6 Pa ) to the ultra-high vacuum within very limited length (<80 cm) ensuring the large beam aperture of more than 40 mm. They are also equipped with compact electrostatic particle removers. We will describe and discuss details of the design, construction and performance of the system., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, M. Parise, D. Passarelli, F. Ruiu, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, P. Duchesne, D. Longuevergne, D. Reynet, Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS/IN2P3, IJCLab, Orsay, France, A total of 35 Superconducting SSR2 spoke cavities will be installed in the PIP II SRF linac at Fermilab and a total of 8 prototype SSR2 cavities will be manufactured for the prototype cryomodule. In this paper, the mechanical design and fabrication aspects of the prototype jacketed SSR2 cavity will be presented. RF and mechanical design activities were conducted in parallel directly on the jacketed cavity in order to minimize the number of design iterations. Also, the lessons learned from other spoke cavities experiences (i.e. SSR1 at Fermilab and ESS double spoke at IPNO) were considered since the early stage of the design., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, S.V. Kutsaev, R.B. Agustsson, P.R. Carriere, A. Moro, A.Yu. Smirnov, K.V. Taletski, RadiaBeam, Santa Monica, California, USA, A.N. Cleland, É. Dumur, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA, ANL, Lemont, Illinois, USA, MEPhI, Moscow, Russia, Quantum computers (QC), if realized, could disrupt many computationally intense fields of science. The building block element of a QC is a quantum bit (qubit). Qubits enable the use of quantum superposition and multi-state entanglement in QC calculations, allowing a QC to simultaneously calculate millions of computations at once. However, quantum states stored in a qubit degrade with decreased quality factors and interactions with the environment. One technical solution to improve qubit lifetimes and network interactions is a circuit comprised of a Josephson junction located inside of a high Q-factor superconducting 3D cavity. RadiaBeam, in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory and The University of Chicago, has developed a superconducting radio-frequency quarter-wave resonant cavity (QWR) for quantum computation. Here a 6 GHz QWR was optimized to include tapering of the inner and outer conductors, a toroidal shape for the resonator shorting plane, and the inner conductor to reduce parasitic capacitance. In this paper, we present the results of the qubit cavity design optimization, fabrication, processing and testing in a single-photon regime at mK temperatures., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, T. Reid, Z.A. Conway, B.M. Guilfoyle, M. Kedzie, M.P. Kelly, M.K. Ng, ANL, Lemont, Illinois, USA, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) has extended high quality cavity processing techniques based on those developed for the International Linear Collider to several more complex superconducting RF cavities. Recently, these include a bunch lengthening harmonic cavity, a crabbing rf-dipole cavity, a compact half-wave cavity, and both medium and high frequency elliptical cavities. These systems are an improved version of the one originally developed for 1.3 GHz 9-cell cavities and include a second rotating electrical contact that can support multiple cathodes, necessary for optimum polishing in difficult cavity geometries. All include the possibility for external water cooling., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, M. Fouaidy, F. Chatelet, V. Delpech, F. Galet, D. Le Dréan, R. Martret, G. Olry, T. Pépin-Donat, Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS/IN2P3, IJCLab, Orsay, France, M. Baudrier, P. Carbonnier, E. Fayette, X. Hanus, Th. Proslier, D. Roudier, P. Sahuquet, C. Servouin, CEA-DRF-IRFU, France, E. Cenni, L. Maurice, CEA-IRFU, Gif-sur-Yvette, France, FLUO, Orsay, France, In the framework of ESS, a vacuum furnace dedicated to High Temperature Heat Treatment under Vacuum (VH2T2) of SRF bulk Nb cavities was developed and commissioned in May 2016. This furnace is currently used for interstitial hydrogen removal (10h00 @ 650 °C) of two type of cavities: 1) the whole series of 26 ESS 352 MHz spoke resonators equipped with their Ti LHe tank well, 2) some prototypes of ESS high beta and medium beta cavities. Up to know IPN Orsay VH2T2 (10h00 @ 650 °C) was successfully applied to more than 16 cavities. In this paper we will first report about these VH2T2 tests. Finally, we have just started testing nitrogen infusion and nitrogen doping processes on samples and 1.3 GHz cavities: the preliminary results will be discussed., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, L. Steder, D. Reschke, DESY, Hamburg, Germany, DESY is and was very active in R&D related to SRF cavities. Many single and nine cell cavities with different surface treatment histories were tested vertically. Results of these cold tests are accelerating gradient and quality factor of the cavities. Using the large number of available datasets the parameters of the 120°C bake procedure, which is applied to avoid high-field Q-slope, are analysed. The impact of different durations and temperatures on accelerating gradient, quality factor and residual resistance is studied in detail and is compared to results obtained with the recently proposed procedure of modified low temperature bake. For this procedure additional four hours at temperatures around 75°C are implemented before the standard bake at about 120°C. Since the claim is, that cavities treated with such a modified procedure achieve extra-ordinary large accelerating gradients it is a very interesting research field for the European XFEL continuous wave mode upgrade. For this purpose cavities with high quality factors are needed, but in addition large maximal accelerating fields are required to maintain high energies in the pulsed operation mode of the accelerator., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, K.N. Nii, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, We have been carrying out R&D on vertical electropolishing (VEP) technique to establish it as an alternate of the horizontal EP (HEP) technique used for the surface treatment of niobium (Nb) superconducting RF (SRF) cavities. We have earlier reported on a VEP parameter study for 1.3 GHz single and nine-cell Nb cavities. The optimized VEP parameters and a unique rotating cathode yielded uniform removal and a smooth surface in the single cell cavity. The unique cathode and a dual flow mechanism for acid circulation were applied to improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. The vertically electropolished single and nine cell cavities achieved the same RF performance as achieved after the HEP processes. We are making efforts to further improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. Here, we report on a VEP of the 1.3 GHz Nb nine-cell cavity at a higher cathode rotation speed of 50 rpm. The VEP results reveal that the speed could be considered for improving the uniformity in removal while maintaining the surface smoothness. Required improvements in the VEP facility and acid flow condition for achieving uniform EP and a smooth surface are also described., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, F. Furuta, D.J. Bicepresenter, A.C. Crawford, T.J. Ring, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, Electro-chemical Polishing (EP) is one of the key technologies of surface treatments for niobium superconducting cavities. We have established a single-cell scale horizontal electro-polishing facility at Fermilab and routinely processed the niobium cavities with the frequencies of 1.3 GHz to 3.9 GHz. The precise control of EP parameters, especially the temperatures of cavity outside wall, allows the uniform removal over the cell with the variation of ±15%.

Indeed, the mechanical polishing is fun-damental also in the superconducting thin film resonant cavities in which one of the main issues that limits the per-formances is the surface preparation. A promising vi-bro-tumbling technique is being studied and implemented with a possibility to replace or improve mechanical treat-ment steps (grinding, barrel polishing). The simplic-ity of the technology allows it to adapt to any cavity geom-etry, both for Nb and Cu materials. The presented work contains last results on 6 GHz cavities obtained at LNL-INFN, both Nb bulk and Cu cavities., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, K.N. Nii, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, Marui Galvanizing Co., Ltd. has been developing vertical electropolishing (VEP) technology for single and nine-cell niobium superconducting radio frequency cavities using a unique cathode namely Ninja cathode in collaboration with KEK. The VEP process usually results in non-uniform removal with a large asymmetry along the cavity length. In order to suppress the asymmetry in removal, we are making different approaches. Flipping of the cavity during the VEP process is one of the approaches applied so far. A unique VEP setup, which allows the flipping of a multi-cell cavity, has been developed as reported earlier. Here, we report the improvement in the setup with automation for cavity flipping. VEP experiments were conducted with the improved system. VEP parameters were studied and the VEP results including the removal trend are discussed in detail., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Y.I. Ida, V. Chouhan, K.N. Niipresenter, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, T. Akabori, G. Mitoya, K. Miyano, HKK, Morioka, Japan, Y. Anetai, F. Takahashi, WING. Co.Ltd, Iwate-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, M. Sawabe, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, The 1st report was delivered in May, 2018 at the IPAC 18 in Vancouver, Canada. The 2nd report was delivered in September, 2018 at the LINAC 18 in Beijing, China. We will make our 3rd report in July, 2019 at the SRF-19 in Dresden, Germany. There will be two main points this time. The first is that by using our improved Ninja Electrode Premium, we can out-perform our number one and number two competitors in terms of uniform electropolishing of the interior of the 9-cell cavity. The second point is that we can remove hydrogen gas, reacted during electropolishing, from the cavity chambers in a manner that has not been successfully achieved by 1st report, May 2018 and 2nd report, September 2018. We will report our 9-cell vertical polishing revolver-type unit that solves the above two problems., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, While the basic process of electropolishing niobium with 1:9 HF:H2SO4 electrolyte has been well characterized, the specific process parameters used to electropolish different superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity geometries requires thoughtful attention. One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization. In preparation for SNS PPU project, JLab performed some EP process development runs with SNS high beta cavities to help identify viable parameter regimes for communication to cavity vendors.

Developing the methods and tools for collecting and characterizing particles found in an accelerator enables process development towards field emission free SRF cavities. Methods are presented for sampling assemblies, components, processes, and environmental conditions utilizing forensic techniques with specialized tooling. Sampling activities to date have produced an inventory of over 850 GSR spindles. Traditional SEM + EDS analysis of this volume of spindles is challenged by labor investment, spindle sampling methods, and the subsequent data pipeline which ultimately results in a statically inadequate dataset for any particulate distribution characterization. A complete systematic analysis of the spindles is enabled by third party software controlling SEM automation for EDS data acquisition. Details of spindle creation, collection equipment, component sampling, automating particle assessment, and data analysis used to characterize samples from beamline elements in CEBAF are presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Y. Jung, B.H. Choi, D.H. Gil, M.O. Hyunpresenter, H. Kim, J.W. Kim, M.S. Kim, D.Y. Lee, J. Lee, S. Lee, IBS, Daejeon, Republic of Korea, Vertical tests of a prototype half-wave resonator cavity are being tested.

An R&D program has started at DESY, to prepare for a CW upgrade. Cryomodules are being tested in CW mode in our CryoModule Test Bench (CMTB) to study the performance and main issues for such an operation mode. Sensitivity to vibration causing microphonics is one of the main concerns for the CW operation in mode. Therefore a detailed analysis is being performed to evaluate the frequency spectrum of the EXFEL cryomodule main components: the cavity itself, the cavity string, the cold mass and the vacuum vessel. Finite Element Modal Analyses have been performed and the results compared with data measured at the CMTB.

The cavities have design loaded-Q of 4×107, which means that it has a control bandwidth of 16 Hz. The JLab prototype cryomodule was instrumented with a series of seven accelerometers, and impulse hammer response measurements were made while the cryomodule was being built and after it was installed in the JLab cryomodule test facility. This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz.

The SRILAC consists of 10 TEM quarter-wavelength resonators made of pure niobium sheets which operate at 4 K. The target performance of each cavity is set as Q0 of 1×109 with its accelerating gradient of 6.8 MV/m. Recently we succeeded to develop high performance SC-cavities which satisfies the requirement with a wide margin.

These modules are based on the ELBE modules of the Helmholtz Center Dresden-Rossendorf but are modified to suit the high current and energy-recovering operation at MESA. The energy gain per module per turn should be 25 MeV, provided by two TESLA cavities, which were vertically tested at DESY, Hamburg, Germany. These tests showed an excellent performance of the quench limit and quality factor for three out of the four cavities. The fourth cavity has a lower but still acceptable quench limit and quality factor. In order to validate the performance of the fully assembled cryomodules after delivery to Mainz a test stand has been set up at the Helmholtz Institut Mainz.

The measurements were performed for fully assembled cavities as well as for bare niobium cavities without the titanium jacket. In the procedure, the instantaneous resonant frequencies were measured for 10 seconds at a time interval of 1 ms and were recorded as a time series. The frequencies were analyzed by means of conventional signal analysis. The power spectrum was deduced from the autocorrelation function calculated with the fluctuation of resonant frequencies. Although the vibration amplitudes were smaller in the cavities assembled with the titanium jacket, we could not find a clear reason for this., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Ab-initio Study of Atomic Scale Interaction Among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O, A.B. Tesfamichael, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, We employed a combination of ab-initio calculations and statistical mechanical models to understand the nature of atomic scale interaction among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O. Because of the profound nature of the interaction, we began our study by focusing only on the interaction of Nb with Sn in the absence of Cl and O. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we calculated: (1), binding energy of both vacant and interstitial of the super cell for both Nb and Sn atoms (2), rate of diffusion and re-evaporation upon transportation of Sn atom across z-axis from bulk Nb layer (3), electron transfer and electric field upon transportation of Sn atom both across z-axis and xy-plane from bulk Nb layer. Our calculation indicated 30-40% difference from experimental results.

This allowed to maintain close to critical coupling even at high field and the data showed that the HFQS did not saturate and that in some cases a power dissipation of up to 200 W at 2 K could be sustained without quench., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, G. Ciovati, G. Cheng, E. Daly, G.V. Eremeev, J. Henry, R.A. Rimmer, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, ODU, Norfolk, Virginia, USA, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia, USA, Industrial application of SRF technology would favor the use of cryocoolers to conductively cool SRF cavities for particle accelerators, operating at or above 4.3 K. In order to achieve a lower surface resistance than Nb at 4.3 K, a superconductor with higher critical temperature should be used, whereas a metal with higher thermal conductivity than Nb should be used to conduct the heat to the cryocoolers. A standard 1.5 GHz bulk Nb single-cell cavity has been coated with a ~2 µm thick layer of Nb3Sn on the inner surface and with a 5 mm thick Cu layer on the outer surface for conduction cooled applications. The cavity performance has been measured at 4.3 K and 2.0 K in liquid He. The cavity reached a peak surface magnetic field of ~40 mT with a quality factor of 6×109 and 3.5×109 at 4.3 K, before and after applying the thick Cu layer, respectively., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, J.T. Maniscalco, T. Gruber, A.T. Holic, M. Liepe, Cornell University (CLASSE), Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education, Ithaca, New York, USA, The Cornell DC Field Dependence Cavity is a new coaxial test resonator designed to study the impact of strong (up to 200 mT or more) DC surface magnetic fields on the superconducting surface resistance, providing physical insight into the root of the ‘‘anti-Q-slope’’ and probing critical fields.

Here we report extensive numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under the strong rf magnetic field. The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force. We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases, Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities. The original production material came from Two vendors Tokyo Denkai Co., Ltd. (TD) and Ningxia Orient Tantalum Industry Co., Ltd. (OTIC/NX)). It was found TD niobium required a lower annealing temperature (900°C) to obtain satisfactory flux expulsion characteristics compared to NX which required a slightly higher annealing temperature (950°-975°C). In order to ensure the new TD material performed equivalent to the niobium produced 4 year before after 900°C annealing; each heat lot of niobium had its flux expulsion characteristics parametrized and custom thermal treatments developed for each lot.

The rollers are moving radially in relation to the rotating cavity and provide an equator diameter reduction. Both devices have the contour close to the cell shape at the equator area.

   Title: Non-Evaporative Getter-Based Differential Pumping System for SRILAC at RIBF

Stable ultra-high vacuum (<10-8 Pa) and particulate-free conditions are strictly necessary for keeping the performance of the superconductive radio frequency (SRF) cavities of the SRILAC. It is crucially important to develop neighboring warm sections to prevent contamination from the existing old RILAC and beamlines built almost four decades ago. In the present study, non-evaporative getter-based differential pumping systems were newly developed to achieve the pressure reduction from the existing beamline vacuum (10-5–10-6 Pa ) to the ultra-high vacuum within very limited length (<80 cm) ensuring the large beam aperture of more than 40 mm. They are also equipped with compact electrostatic particle removers. We will describe and discuss details of the design, construction and performance of the system., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, M. Parise, D. Passarelli, F. Ruiu, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, P. Duchesne, D. Longuevergne, D. Reynet, Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS/IN2P3, IJCLab, Orsay, France, A total of 35 Superconducting SSR2 spoke cavities will be installed in the PIP II SRF linac at Fermilab and a total of 8 prototype SSR2 cavities will be manufactured for the prototype cryomodule. In this paper, the mechanical design and fabrication aspects of the prototype jacketed SSR2 cavity will be presented. RF and mechanical design activities were conducted in parallel directly on the jacketed cavity in order to minimize the number of design iterations. Also, the lessons learned from other spoke cavities experiences (i.e. SSR1 at Fermilab and ESS double spoke at IPNO) were considered since the early stage of the design., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, S.V. Kutsaev, R.B. Agustsson, P.R. Carriere, A. Moro, A.Yu. Smirnov, K.V. Taletski, RadiaBeam, Santa Monica, California, USA, A.N. Cleland, É. Dumur, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA, ANL, Lemont, Illinois, USA, MEPhI, Moscow, Russia, Quantum computers (QC), if realized, could disrupt many computationally intense fields of science. The building block element of a QC is a quantum bit (qubit). Qubits enable the use of quantum superposition and multi-state entanglement in QC calculations, allowing a QC to simultaneously calculate millions of computations at once. However, quantum states stored in a qubit degrade with decreased quality factors and interactions with the environment. One technical solution to improve qubit lifetimes and network interactions is a circuit comprised of a Josephson junction located inside of a high Q-factor superconducting 3D cavity. RadiaBeam, in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory and The University of Chicago, has developed a superconducting radio-frequency quarter-wave resonant cavity (QWR) for quantum computation. Here a 6 GHz QWR was optimized to include tapering of the inner and outer conductors, a toroidal shape for the resonator shorting plane, and the inner conductor to reduce parasitic capacitance. In this paper, we present the results of the qubit cavity design optimization, fabrication, processing and testing in a single-photon regime at mK temperatures., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, T. Reid, Z.A. Conway, B.M. Guilfoyle, M. Kedzie, M.P. Kelly, M.K. Ng, ANL, Lemont, Illinois, USA, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) has extended high quality cavity processing techniques based on those developed for the International Linear Collider to several more complex superconducting RF cavities.

This furnace is currently used for interstitial hydrogen removal (10h00 @ 650 °C) of two type of cavities: 1) the whole series of 26 ESS 352 MHz spoke resonators equipped with their Ti LHe tank well, 2) some prototypes of ESS high beta and medium beta cavities. Up to know IPN Orsay VH2T2 (10h00 @ 650 °C) was successfully applied to more than 16 cavities. In this paper we will first report about these VH2T2 tests. Finally, we have just started testing nitrogen infusion and nitrogen doping processes on samples and 1.3 GHz cavities: the preliminary results will be discussed., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, L. Steder, D. Reschke, DESY, Hamburg, Germany, DESY is and was very active in R&D related to SRF cavities. Many single and nine cell cavities with different surface treatment histories were tested vertically. Results of these cold tests are accelerating gradient and quality factor of the cavities. Using the large number of available datasets the parameters of the 120°C bake procedure, which is applied to avoid high-field Q-slope, are analysed. The impact of different durations and temperatures on accelerating gradient, quality factor and residual resistance is studied in detail and is compared to results obtained with the recently proposed procedure of modified low temperature bake. For this procedure additional four hours at temperatures around 75°C are implemented before the standard bake at about 120°C. Since the claim is, that cavities treated with such a modified procedure achieve extra-ordinary large accelerating gradients it is a very interesting research field for the European XFEL continuous wave mode upgrade. For this purpose cavities with high quality factors are needed, but in addition large maximal accelerating fields are required to maintain high energies in the pulsed operation mode of the accelerator., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, K.N. Nii, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, We have been carrying out R&D on vertical electropolishing (VEP) technique to establish it as an alternate of the horizontal EP (HEP) technique used for the surface treatment of niobium (Nb) superconducting RF (SRF) cavities. We have earlier reported on a VEP parameter study for 1.3 GHz single and nine-cell Nb cavities. The optimized VEP parameters and a unique rotating cathode yielded uniform removal and a smooth surface in the single cell cavity. The unique cathode and a dual flow mechanism for acid circulation were applied to improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. The vertically electropolished single and nine cell cavities achieved the same RF performance as achieved after the HEP processes. We are making efforts to further improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. Here, we report on a VEP of the 1.3 GHz Nb nine-cell cavity at a higher cathode rotation speed of 50 rpm. The VEP results reveal that the speed could be considered for improving the uniformity in removal while maintaining the surface smoothness. Required improvements in the VEP facility and acid flow condition for achieving uniform EP and a smooth surface are also described., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, F. Furuta, D.J. Bicepresenter, A.C. Crawford, T.J. Ring, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, Electro-chemical Polishing (EP) is one of the key technologies of surface treatments for niobium superconducting cavities.

Indeed, the mechanical polishing is fun-damental also in the superconducting thin film resonant cavities in which one of the main issues that limits the per-formances is the surface preparation. A promising vi-bro-tumbling technique is being studied and implemented with a possibility to replace or improve mechanical treat-ment steps (grinding, barrel polishing). The simplic-ity of the technology allows it to adapt to any cavity geom-etry, both for Nb and Cu materials.

The VEP process usually results in non-uniform removal with a large asymmetry along the cavity length. In order to suppress the asymmetry in removal, we are making different approaches. Flipping of the cavity during the VEP process is one of the approaches applied so far. A unique VEP setup, which allows the flipping of a multi-cell cavity, has been developed as reported earlier. Here, we report the improvement in the setup with automation for cavity flipping. VEP experiments were conducted with the improved system.

The 2nd report was delivered in September, 2018 at the LINAC 18 in Beijing, China. We will make our 3rd report in July, 2019 at the SRF-19 in Dresden, Germany. There will be two main points this time. The first is that by using our improved Ninja Electrode Premium, we can out-perform our number one and number two competitors in terms of uniform electropolishing of the interior of the 9-cell cavity. The second point is that we can remove hydrogen gas, reacted during electropolishing, from the cavity chambers in a manner that has not been successfully achieved by 1st report, May 2018 and 2nd report, September 2018. We will report our 9-cell vertical polishing revolver-type unit that solves the above two problems., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, While the basic process of electropolishing niobium with 1:9 HF:H2SO4 electrolyte has been well characterized, the specific process parameters used to electropolish different superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity geometries requires thoughtful attention. One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization. In preparation for SNS PPU project, JLab performed some EP process development runs with SNS high beta cavities to help identify viable parameter regimes for communication to cavity vendors.

Developing the methods and tools for collecting and characterizing particles found in an accelerator enables process development towards field emission free SRF cavities. Methods are presented for sampling assemblies, components, processes, and environmental conditions utilizing forensic techniques with specialized tooling. Sampling activities to date have produced an inventory of over 850 GSR spindles. Traditional SEM + EDS analysis of this volume of spindles is challenged by labor investment, spindle sampling methods, and the subsequent data pipeline which ultimately results in a statically inadequate dataset for any particulate distribution characterization. A complete systematic analysis of the spindles is enabled by third party software controlling SEM automation for EDS data acquisition.

An R&D program has started at DESY, to prepare for a CW upgrade. Cryomodules are being tested in CW mode in our CryoModule Test Bench (CMTB) to study the performance and main issues for such an operation mode. Sensitivity to vibration causing microphonics is one of the main concerns for the CW operation in mode. Therefore a detailed analysis is being performed to evaluate the frequency spectrum of the EXFEL cryomodule main components: the cavity itself, the cavity string, the cold mass and the vacuum vessel.

The cavities have design loaded-Q of 4×107, which means that it has a control bandwidth of 16 Hz. The JLab prototype cryomodule was instrumented with a series of seven accelerometers, and impulse hammer response measurements were made while the cryomodule was being built and after it was installed in the JLab cryomodule test facility. This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz. Results of the modal analysis as well as the background microphonics observed when operated under various cryogenic conditions and with different modifications will be presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, B. Schriefer, W. Anders, A. Heugel, H. Hoffmann, G. Mielczarek, H. Stein, HZB, Berlin, Germany, In Berlin-Adlershof the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) is constructing the energy recovery linac ¿BERLinPro¿.

These modules are based on the ELBE modules of the Helmholtz Center Dresden-Rossendorf but are modified to suit the high current and energy-recovering operation at MESA. The energy gain per module per turn should be 25 MeV, provided by two TESLA cavities, which were vertically tested at DESY, Hamburg, Germany. These tests showed an excellent performance of the quench limit and quality factor for three out of the four cavities. The fourth cavity has a lower but still acceptable quench limit and quality factor.

The measurements were performed for fully assembled cavities as well as for bare niobium cavities without the titanium jacket. In the procedure, the instantaneous resonant frequencies were measured for 10 seconds at a time interval of 1 ms and were recorded as a time series. The frequencies were analyzed by means of conventional signal analysis. The power spectrum was deduced from the autocorrelation function calculated with the fluctuation of resonant frequencies.

Because of the profound nature of the interaction, we began our study by focusing only on the interaction of Nb with Sn in the absence of Cl and O. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we calculated: (1), binding energy of both vacant and interstitial of the super cell for both Nb and Sn atoms (2), rate of diffusion and re-evaporation upon transportation of Sn atom across z-axis from bulk Nb layer (3), electron transfer and electric field upon transportation of Sn atom both across z-axis and xy-plane from bulk Nb layer. Our calculation indicated 30-40% difference from experimental results.

We study the thermodynamics of impurities and hydrides in the near-surface region as well as their effect on the surface band gap. This makes it possible for experimentalists to relate changes in STM dI/dV measurements resulting from different preparations to changes in subsurface structure. We also calculate matrix elements for electron-impurity scattering in Nb for common impurities O, N, C, and H. By transforming these matrix elements into a Wannier function basis, we calculate lifetimes for a dense set of states on the Fermi surface and determine the mean free path as a function of impurity density.

In order to achieve a lower surface resistance than Nb at 4.3 K, a superconductor with higher critical temperature should be used, whereas a metal with higher thermal conductivity than Nb should be used to conduct the heat to the cryocoolers.

Here we report extensive numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under the strong rf magnetic field. The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force. We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases, Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities.

It was found TD niobium required a lower annealing temperature (900°C) to obtain satisfactory flux expulsion characteristics compared to NX which required a slightly higher annealing temperature (950°-975°C). In order to ensure the new TD material performed equivalent to the niobium produced 4 year before after 900°C annealing; each heat lot of niobium had its flux expulsion characteristics parametrized and custom thermal treatments developed for each lot.

RF and mechanical design activities were conducted in parallel directly on the jacketed cavity in order to minimize the number of design iterations. Also, the lessons learned from other spoke cavities experiences (i.e. SSR1 at Fermilab and ESS double spoke at IPNO) were considered since the early stage of the design., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, S.V. Kutsaev, R.B. Agustsson, P.R. Carriere, A. Moro, A.Yu. Smirnov, K.V. Taletski, RadiaBeam, Santa Monica, California, USA, A.N. Cleland, É. Dumur, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA, ANL, Lemont, Illinois, USA, MEPhI, Moscow, Russia, Quantum computers (QC), if realized, could disrupt many computationally intense fields of science. The building block element of a QC is a quantum bit (qubit). Qubits enable the use of quantum superposition and multi-state entanglement in QC calculations, allowing a QC to simultaneously calculate millions of computations at once. However, quantum states stored in a qubit degrade with decreased quality factors and interactions with the environment. One technical solution to improve qubit lifetimes and network interactions is a circuit comprised of a Josephson junction located inside of a high Q-factor superconducting 3D cavity. RadiaBeam, in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory and The University of Chicago, has developed a superconducting radio-frequency quarter-wave resonant cavity (QWR) for quantum computation. Here a 6 GHz QWR was optimized to include tapering of the inner and outer conductors, a toroidal shape for the resonator shorting plane, and the inner conductor to reduce parasitic capacitance.

This furnace is currently used for interstitial hydrogen removal (10h00 @ 650 °C) of two type of cavities: 1) the whole series of 26 ESS 352 MHz spoke resonators equipped with their Ti LHe tank well, 2) some prototypes of ESS high beta and medium beta cavities. Up to know IPN Orsay VH2T2 (10h00 @ 650 °C) was successfully applied to more than 16 cavities. In this paper we will first report about these VH2T2 tests.

Many single and nine cell cavities with different surface treatment histories were tested vertically. Results of these cold tests are accelerating gradient and quality factor of the cavities. Using the large number of available datasets the parameters of the 120°C bake procedure, which is applied to avoid high-field Q-slope, are analysed. The impact of different durations and temperatures on accelerating gradient, quality factor and residual resistance is studied in detail and is compared to results obtained with the recently proposed procedure of modified low temperature bake. For this procedure additional four hours at temperatures around 75°C are implemented before the standard bake at about 120°C. Since the claim is, that cavities treated with such a modified procedure achieve extra-ordinary large accelerating gradients it is a very interesting research field for the European XFEL continuous wave mode upgrade. For this purpose cavities with high quality factors are needed, but in addition large maximal accelerating fields are required to maintain high energies in the pulsed operation mode of the accelerator., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, K.N. Nii, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, We have been carrying out R&D on vertical electropolishing (VEP) technique to establish it as an alternate of the horizontal EP (HEP) technique used for the surface treatment of niobium (Nb) superconducting RF (SRF) cavities. We have earlier reported on a VEP parameter study for 1.3 GHz single and nine-cell Nb cavities. The optimized VEP parameters and a unique rotating cathode yielded uniform removal and a smooth surface in the single cell cavity. The unique cathode and a dual flow mechanism for acid circulation were applied to improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. The vertically electropolished single and nine cell cavities achieved the same RF performance as achieved after the HEP processes. We are making efforts to further improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. Here, we report on a VEP of the 1.3 GHz Nb nine-cell cavity at a higher cathode rotation speed of 50 rpm. The VEP results reveal that the speed could be considered for improving the uniformity in removal while maintaining the surface smoothness.

The VEP process usually results in non-uniform removal with a large asymmetry along the cavity length. In order to suppress the asymmetry in removal, we are making different approaches. Flipping of the cavity during the VEP process is one of the approaches applied so far. A unique VEP setup, which allows the flipping of a multi-cell cavity, has been developed as reported earlier. Here, we report the improvement in the setup with automation for cavity flipping. VEP experiments were conducted with the improved system. VEP parameters were studied and the VEP results including the removal trend are discussed in detail., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Y.I. Ida, V. Chouhan, K.N. Niipresenter, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, T. Akabori, G. Mitoya, K. Miyano, HKK, Morioka, Japan, Y. Anetai, F. Takahashi, WING. Co.Ltd, Iwate-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, M. Sawabe, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, The 1st report was delivered in May, 2018 at the IPAC 18 in Vancouver, Canada. The 2nd report was delivered in September, 2018 at the LINAC 18 in Beijing, China. We will make our 3rd report in July, 2019 at the SRF-19 in Dresden, Germany. There will be two main points this time. The first is that by using our improved Ninja Electrode Premium, we can out-perform our number one and number two competitors in terms of uniform electropolishing of the interior of the 9-cell cavity. The second point is that we can remove hydrogen gas, reacted during electropolishing, from the cavity chambers in a manner that has not been successfully achieved by 1st report, May 2018 and 2nd report, September 2018. We will report our 9-cell vertical polishing revolver-type unit that solves the above two problems., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, While the basic process of electropolishing niobium with 1:9 HF:H2SO4 electrolyte has been well characterized, the specific process parameters used to electropolish different superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity geometries requires thoughtful attention. One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization. In preparation for SNS PPU project, JLab performed some EP process development runs with SNS high beta cavities to help identify viable parameter regimes for communication to cavity vendors.

Developing the methods and tools for collecting and characterizing particles found in an accelerator enables process development towards field emission free SRF cavities. Methods are presented for sampling assemblies, components, processes, and environmental conditions utilizing forensic techniques with specialized tooling. Sampling activities to date have produced an inventory of over 850 GSR spindles. Traditional SEM + EDS analysis of this volume of spindles is challenged by labor investment, spindle sampling methods, and the subsequent data pipeline which ultimately results in a statically inadequate dataset for any particulate distribution characterization. A complete systematic analysis of the spindles is enabled by third party software controlling SEM automation for EDS data acquisition.

An R&D program has started at DESY, to prepare for a CW upgrade. Cryomodules are being tested in CW mode in our CryoModule Test Bench (CMTB) to study the performance and main issues for such an operation mode. Sensitivity to vibration causing microphonics is one of the main concerns for the CW operation in mode. Therefore a detailed analysis is being performed to evaluate the frequency spectrum of the EXFEL cryomodule main components: the cavity itself, the cavity string, the cold mass and the vacuum vessel. Finite Element Modal Analyses have been performed and the results compared with data measured at the CMTB.

The cavities have design loaded-Q of 4×107, which means that it has a control bandwidth of 16 Hz. The JLab prototype cryomodule was instrumented with a series of seven accelerometers, and impulse hammer response measurements were made while the cryomodule was being built and after it was installed in the JLab cryomodule test facility. This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz.

In this project, a new superconducting (SC) booster linac, so-called SRILAC, is being developed and constructed. The SRILAC consists of 10 TEM quarter-wavelength resonators made of pure niobium sheets which operate at 4 K. The target performance of each cavity is set as Q0 of 1×109 with its accelerating gradient of 6.8 MV/m.

These modules are based on the ELBE modules of the Helmholtz Center Dresden-Rossendorf but are modified to suit the high current and energy-recovering operation at MESA. The energy gain per module per turn should be 25 MeV, provided by two TESLA cavities, which were vertically tested at DESY, Hamburg, Germany. These tests showed an excellent performance of the quench limit and quality factor for three out of the four cavities. The fourth cavity has a lower but still acceptable quench limit and quality factor.

The measurements were performed for fully assembled cavities as well as for bare niobium cavities without the titanium jacket. In the procedure, the instantaneous resonant frequencies were measured for 10 seconds at a time interval of 1 ms and were recorded as a time series. The frequencies were analyzed by means of conventional signal analysis. The power spectrum was deduced from the autocorrelation function calculated with the fluctuation of resonant frequencies.

Because of the profound nature of the interaction, we began our study by focusing only on the interaction of Nb with Sn in the absence of Cl and O. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we calculated: (1), binding energy of both vacant and interstitial of the super cell for both Nb and Sn atoms (2), rate of diffusion and re-evaporation upon transportation of Sn atom across z-axis from bulk Nb layer (3), electron transfer and electric field upon transportation of Sn atom both across z-axis and xy-plane from bulk Nb layer. Our calculation indicated 30-40% difference from experimental results.

We study the thermodynamics of impurities and hydrides in the near-surface region as well as their effect on the surface band gap. This makes it possible for experimentalists to relate changes in STM dI/dV measurements resulting from different preparations to changes in subsurface structure. We also calculate matrix elements for electron-impurity scattering in Nb for common impurities O, N, C, and H. By transforming these matrix elements into a Wannier function basis, we calculate lifetimes for a dense set of states on the Fermi surface and determine the mean free path as a function of impurity density.

Several models and experimental studies have been proposed and performed over the years to understand the origin of these anomalous losses but a general consensus on what these orgins are is yet to be established. In this contribution, we present the results from the RF tests of several 1.3 GHz single-cell cavities limited by the HFQS and tested using a variable input coupler.

In order to achieve a lower surface resistance than Nb at 4.3 K, a superconductor with higher critical temperature should be used, whereas a metal with higher thermal conductivity than Nb should be used to conduct the heat to the cryocoolers. A standard 1.5 GHz bulk Nb single-cell cavity has been coated with a ~2 µm thick layer of Nb3Sn on the inner surface and with a 5 mm thick Cu layer on the outer surface for conduction cooled applications.

Here we report extensive numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under the strong rf magnetic field. The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force. We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases, Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities.

It was found TD niobium required a lower annealing temperature (900°C) to obtain satisfactory flux expulsion characteristics compared to NX which required a slightly higher annealing temperature (950°-975°C). In order to ensure the new TD material performed equivalent to the niobium produced 4 year before after 900°C annealing; each heat lot of niobium had its flux expulsion characteristics parametrized and custom thermal treatments developed for each lot.

Radial deformation of cavity cells can be provided by a special chain or a rolling device with three rollers. The chain distributes the radial forces on the equator area around the cell. The rollers are moving radially in relation to the rotating cavity and provide an equator diameter reduction. Both devices have the contour close to the cell shape at the equator area. The required equator radius deviation depends on the tuning target and usually varies between (0.02…0.60) mm.

The building block element of a QC is a quantum bit (qubit). Qubits enable the use of quantum superposition and multi-state entanglement in QC calculations, allowing a QC to simultaneously calculate millions of computations at once. However, quantum states stored in a qubit degrade with decreased quality factors and interactions with the environment. One technical solution to improve qubit lifetimes and network interactions is a circuit comprised of a Josephson junction located inside of a high Q-factor superconducting 3D cavity. RadiaBeam, in collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory and The University of Chicago, has developed a superconducting radio-frequency quarter-wave resonant cavity (QWR) for quantum computation.

Many single and nine cell cavities with different surface treatment histories were tested vertically. Results of these cold tests are accelerating gradient and quality factor of the cavities. Using the large number of available datasets the parameters of the 120°C bake procedure, which is applied to avoid high-field Q-slope, are analysed. The impact of different durations and temperatures on accelerating gradient, quality factor and residual resistance is studied in detail and is compared to results obtained with the recently proposed procedure of modified low temperature bake. For this procedure additional four hours at temperatures around 75°C are implemented before the standard bake at about 120°C. Since the claim is, that cavities treated with such a modified procedure achieve extra-ordinary large accelerating gradients it is a very interesting research field for the European XFEL continuous wave mode upgrade. For this purpose cavities with high quality factors are needed, but in addition large maximal accelerating fields are required to maintain high energies in the pulsed operation mode of the accelerator., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, K.N. Nii, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, We have been carrying out R&D on vertical electropolishing (VEP) technique to establish it as an alternate of the horizontal EP (HEP) technique used for the surface treatment of niobium (Nb) superconducting RF (SRF) cavities. We have earlier reported on a VEP parameter study for 1.3 GHz single and nine-cell Nb cavities. The optimized VEP parameters and a unique rotating cathode yielded uniform removal and a smooth surface in the single cell cavity. The unique cathode and a dual flow mechanism for acid circulation were applied to improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. The vertically electropolished single and nine cell cavities achieved the same RF performance as achieved after the HEP processes. We are making efforts to further improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. Here, we report on a VEP of the 1.3 GHz Nb nine-cell cavity at a higher cathode rotation speed of 50 rpm. The VEP results reveal that the speed could be considered for improving the uniformity in removal while maintaining the surface smoothness.

There will be two main points this time. The first is that by using our improved Ninja Electrode Premium, we can out-perform our number one and number two competitors in terms of uniform electropolishing of the interior of the 9-cell cavity. The second point is that we can remove hydrogen gas, reacted during electropolishing, from the cavity chambers in a manner that has not been successfully achieved by 1st report, May 2018 and 2nd report, September 2018.

One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure.

The RF and mechanical design of the SSR2 cavities has been completed and satisfies the technical requirements. However, our resent results of the high RF power tests of fully dressed SSR1 cavities show considerably strong multipacting (MP), which took significant time to process. On the other hand, the new results of the tests of balloon cavity showed significant mitigation of MP. In this paper we present the results of the improved design of the SSR2 cavity, based on the balloon cavity concept. The electromagnetic design is presented, including RF parameter optimization, MP simulations, field asymmetry analysis, High Order Mode (HOM) calculations. Mechanical analysis of the dressed cavity is presented also, which includes Lorentz Force Detuning optimization, and reduction of the cavity resonance frequency sensitivity versus He pressure fluctuations. The design completely satisfies the PIP II technical requirements., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS

Radial deformation of cavity cells can be provided by a special chain or a rolling device with three rollers. The chain distributes the radial forces on the equator area around the cell. The rollers are moving radially in relation to the rotating cavity and provide an equator diameter reduction. Both devices have the contour close to the cell shape at the equator area. The required equator radius deviation depends on the tuning target and usually varies between (0.02…0.60) mm.

   Title: New SRF Structures Processed at the ANL Cavity Processing Facility
   Authors: T. Reid, Z.A. Conway, B.M. Guilfoyle, M. Kedzie, M.P. Kelly, M.K. Ng, ANL, Lemont, Illinois, USA, Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) has extended high quality cavity processing techniques based on those developed for the International Linear Collider to several more complex superconducting RF cavities. Recently, these include a bunch lengthening harmonic cavity, a crabbing rf-dipole cavity, a compact half-wave cavity, and both medium and high frequency elliptical cavities. These systems are an improved version of the one originally developed for 1.3 GHz 9-cell cavities and include a second rotating electrical contact that can support multiple cathodes, necessary for optimum polishing in difficult cavity geometries. All include the possibility for external water cooling., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, M. Fouaidy, F. Chatelet, V. Delpech, F. Galet, D. Le Dréan, R. Martret, G. Olry, T. Pépin-Donat, Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS/IN2P3, IJCLab, Orsay, France, M. Baudrier, P. Carbonnier, E. Fayette, X. Hanus, Th. Proslier, D. Roudier, P. Sahuquet, C. Servouin, CEA-DRF-IRFU, France, E. Cenni, L. Maurice, CEA-IRFU, Gif-sur-Yvette, France, FLUO, Orsay, France, In the framework of ESS, a vacuum furnace dedicated to High Temperature Heat Treatment under Vacuum (VH2T2) of SRF bulk Nb cavities was developed and commissioned in May 2016. This furnace is currently used for interstitial hydrogen removal (10h00 @ 650 °C) of two type of cavities: 1) the whole series of 26 ESS 352 MHz spoke resonators equipped with their Ti LHe tank well, 2) some prototypes of ESS high beta and medium beta cavities. Up to know IPN Orsay VH2T2 (10h00 @ 650 °C) was successfully applied to more than 16 cavities. In this paper we will first report about these VH2T2 tests. Finally, we have just started testing nitrogen infusion and nitrogen doping processes on samples and 1.3 GHz cavities: the preliminary results will be discussed., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, L. Steder, D. Reschke, DESY, Hamburg, Germany, DESY is and was very active in R&D related to SRF cavities. Many single and nine cell cavities with different surface treatment histories were tested vertically. Results of these cold tests are accelerating gradient and quality factor of the cavities. Using the large number of available datasets the parameters of the 120°C bake procedure, which is applied to avoid high-field Q-slope, are analysed. The impact of different durations and temperatures on accelerating gradient, quality factor and residual resistance is studied in detail and is compared to results obtained with the recently proposed procedure of modified low temperature bake. For this procedure additional four hours at temperatures around 75°C are implemented before the standard bake at about 120°C. Since the claim is, that cavities treated with such a modified procedure achieve extra-ordinary large accelerating gradients it is a very interesting research field for the European XFEL continuous wave mode upgrade. For this purpose cavities with high quality factors are needed, but in addition large maximal accelerating fields are required to maintain high energies in the pulsed operation mode of the accelerator., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, K.N. Nii, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, We have been carrying out R&D on vertical electropolishing (VEP) technique to establish it as an alternate of the horizontal EP (HEP) technique used for the surface treatment of niobium (Nb) superconducting RF (SRF) cavities. We have earlier reported on a VEP parameter study for 1.3 GHz single and nine-cell Nb cavities. The optimized VEP parameters and a unique rotating cathode yielded uniform removal and a smooth surface in the single cell cavity. The unique cathode and a dual flow mechanism for acid circulation were applied to improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. The vertically electropolished single and nine cell cavities achieved the same RF performance as achieved after the HEP processes. We are making efforts to further improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. Here, we report on a VEP of the 1.3 GHz Nb nine-cell cavity at a higher cathode rotation speed of 50 rpm. The VEP results reveal that the speed could be considered for improving the uniformity in removal while maintaining the surface smoothness. Required improvements in the VEP facility and acid flow condition for achieving uniform EP and a smooth surface are also described., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, F. Furuta, D.J. Bicepresenter, A.C. Crawford, T.J. Ring, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, Electro-chemical Polishing (EP) is one of the key technologies of surface treatments for niobium superconducting cavities. We have established a single-cell scale horizontal electro-polishing facility at Fermilab and routinely processed the niobium cavities with the frequencies of 1.3 GHz to 3.9 GHz. The precise control of EP parameters, especially the temperatures of cavity outside wall, allows the uniform removal over the cell with the variation of ±15%. Here we report the details of our EP process and recent improvements on our EP facility at Fermilab., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, A. Sulimov, J.H. Thie, DESY, Hamburg, Germany, Ettore Zanon S.p.A., Nuclear Division, Schio, Italy, RI Research Instruments GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, A. Sulimov, J.H. Thie, DESY, Hamburg, Germany, ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, E. Chyhyrynets, O. Azzolini, V.A. Garcia, G. Keppel, C. Pirapresenter, F. Stivanello, L. Zanotto, INFN/LNL, Legnaro (PD), Italy, Centrifugal Barrel Polishing (CBP) is a common tool in the Nb bulk SC cavities production, prior to elec-tropolishing (EP). Indeed, the mechanical polishing is fun-damental also in the superconducting thin film resonant cavities in which one of the main issues that limits the per-formances is the surface preparation. A promising vi-bro-tumbling technique is being studied and implemented with a possibility to replace or improve mechanical treat-ment steps (grinding, barrel polishing). The simplic-ity of the technology allows it to adapt to any cavity geom-etry, both for Nb and Cu materials. The presented work contains last results on 6 GHz cavities obtained at LNL-INFN, both Nb bulk and Cu cavities., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, K.N. Nii, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, Marui Galvanizing Co., Ltd. has been developing vertical electropolishing (VEP) technology for single and nine-cell niobium superconducting radio frequency cavities using a unique cathode namely Ninja cathode in collaboration with KEK. The VEP process usually results in non-uniform removal with a large asymmetry along the cavity length. In order to suppress the asymmetry in removal, we are making different approaches. Flipping of the cavity during the VEP process is one of the approaches applied so far. A unique VEP setup, which allows the flipping of a multi-cell cavity, has been developed as reported earlier. Here, we report the improvement in the setup with automation for cavity flipping. VEP experiments were conducted with the improved system. VEP parameters were studied and the VEP results including the removal trend are discussed in detail., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Y.I. Ida, V. Chouhan, K.N. Niipresenter, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, T. Akabori, G. Mitoya, K. Miyano, HKK, Morioka, Japan, Y. Anetai, F. Takahashi, WING. Co.Ltd, Iwate-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, M. Sawabe, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, The 1st report was delivered in May, 2018 at the IPAC 18 in Vancouver, Canada. The 2nd report was delivered in September, 2018 at the LINAC 18 in Beijing, China. We will make our 3rd report in July, 2019 at the SRF-19 in Dresden, Germany. There will be two main points this time. The first is that by using our improved Ninja Electrode Premium, we can out-perform our number one and number two competitors in terms of uniform electropolishing of the interior of the 9-cell cavity. The second point is that we can remove hydrogen gas, reacted during electropolishing, from the cavity chambers in a manner that has not been successfully achieved by 1st report, May 2018 and 2nd report, September 2018. We will report our 9-cell vertical polishing revolver-type unit that solves the above two problems., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, While the basic process of electropolishing niobium with 1:9 HF:H2SO4 electrolyte has been well characterized, the specific process parameters used to electropolish different superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity geometries requires thoughtful attention. One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization. In preparation for SNS PPU project, JLab performed some EP process development runs with SNS high beta cavities to help identify viable parameter regimes for communication to cavity vendors. Results from this study are presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, J.K. Spradlin, C.E. Reecepresenter, O. Trofimova, A-M. Valente-Feliciano, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, Foreign particles residing on the field carrying surface of accelerator cavities are a known mechanism for field emission. Developing the methods and tools for collecting and characterizing particles found in an accelerator enables process development towards field emission free SRF cavities. Methods are presented for sampling assemblies, components, processes, and environmental conditions utilizing forensic techniques with specialized tooling. Sampling activities to date have produced an inventory of over 850 GSR spindles. Traditional SEM + EDS analysis of this volume of spindles is challenged by labor investment, spindle sampling methods, and the subsequent data pipeline which ultimately results in a statically inadequate dataset for any particulate distribution characterization. A complete systematic analysis of the spindles is enabled by third party software controlling SEM automation for EDS data acquisition. Details of spindle creation, collection equipment, component sampling, automating particle assessment, and data analysis used to characterize samples from beamline elements in CEBAF are presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Y. Jung, B.H. Choi, D.H. Gil, M.O. Hyunpresenter, H. Kim, J.W. Kim, M.S. Kim, D.Y. Lee, J. Lee, S. Lee, IBS, Daejeon, Republic of Korea, Vertical tests of a prototype half-wave resonator cavity are being tested. The performance of the cavities, such as quality factor and accelerating electrical field, are measured and compared to the target design value. In previous study, we reported the effect of the heat treatment on a prototype bare HWR cavity. We baked a jacketed HWR cavity to improve a performance for 10 h at 650°C. In this study, we will report the effect of the heat treatment on the jacketed HWR cavity., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, M.O. Hyun, H.C. Jung, Y. Kim, M. Lee, IBS, Daejeon, Republic of Korea, The Rare Isotope Science Project (RISP) in the Institute of Basic Science (IBS), Korea, is developing and con-structing the multi-purpose linear accelerator at the north side of Daejeon, South Korea. RISP accelerator (RAON) is composed with low-energy region (SCL3) and high-energy region (SCL2), and low-energy region is made with quarter-wave resonator (QWR) and half-wave resonator (HWR) when high-energy region is made with single spoke resonator type-1 (SSR1) and type-2 (SSR2). This paper shows about the initial resonance issues of QWR superconducting (SC) cavity during cold test and SRF disturbance measurement.

An R&D program has started at DESY, to prepare for a CW upgrade. Cryomodules are being tested in CW mode in our CryoModule Test Bench (CMTB) to study the performance and main issues for such an operation mode. Sensitivity to vibration causing microphonics is one of the main concerns for the CW operation in mode. Therefore a detailed analysis is being performed to evaluate the frequency spectrum of the EXFEL cryomodule main components: the cavity itself, the cavity string, the cold mass and the vacuum vessel. Finite Element Modal Analyses have been performed and the results compared with data measured at the CMTB. This paper summarizes the main results and conclusions of such a study., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, T. Powers, N.C. Brock, G.K. Davis, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, Jefferson Lab is partnering with Fermilab to build the 36 cryomodules for the LCLS II accelerator that will be installed at SLAC. The cavities have design loaded-Q of 4×107, which means that it has a control bandwidth of 16 Hz. The JLab prototype cryomodule was instrumented with a series of seven accelerometers, and impulse hammer response measurements were made while the cryomodule was being built and after it was installed in the JLab cryomodule test facility. This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz. Results of the modal analysis as well as the background microphonics observed when operated under various cryogenic conditions and with different modifications will be presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, B. Schriefer, W. Anders, A. Heugel, H. Hoffmann, G. Mielczarek, H. Stein, HZB, Berlin, Germany, In Berlin-Adlershof the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) is constructing the energy recovery linac ¿BERLinPro¿.

In this project, a new superconducting (SC) booster linac, so-called SRILAC, is being developed and constructed. The SRILAC consists of 10 TEM quarter-wavelength resonators made of pure niobium sheets which operate at 4 K. The target performance of each cavity is set as Q0 of 1×109 with its accelerating gradient of 6.8 MV/m. Recently we succeeded to develop high performance SC-cavities which satisfies the requirement with a wide margin. The cryomodule assembly is under way, and installation of cryomodules and He liquefaction system will be completed by the end of FY2018. The cooling-down test is scheduled in the Q1 of FY2019.

These modules are based on the ELBE modules of the Helmholtz Center Dresden-Rossendorf but are modified to suit the high current and energy-recovering operation at MESA. The energy gain per module per turn should be 25 MeV, provided by two TESLA cavities, which were vertically tested at DESY, Hamburg, Germany. These tests showed an excellent performance of the quench limit and quality factor for three out of the four cavities. The fourth cavity has a lower but still acceptable quench limit and quality factor. In order to validate the performance of the fully assembled cryomodules after delivery to Mainz a test stand has been set up at the Helmholtz Institut Mainz. The test stand is described in detail and the status of the module testing is reported., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, O. Kamigaito, K. Ozeki, N. Sakamoto, K. Suda, K. Yamada, RIKEN Nishina Center, Wako, Japan, Mechanical vibration of quarter-wavelength resonators of SRILAC, the superconducting booster of the RIKEN heavy-ion linac, was measured during a vertical cold test. The measurements were performed for fully assembled cavities as well as for bare niobium cavities without the titanium jacket. In the procedure, the instantaneous resonant frequencies were measured for 10 seconds at a time interval of 1 ms and were recorded as a time series. The frequencies were analyzed by means of conventional signal analysis. The power spectrum was deduced from the autocorrelation function calculated with the fluctuation of resonant frequencies. Although the vibration amplitudes were smaller in the cavities assembled with the titanium jacket, we could not find a clear reason for this., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Ab-initio Study of Atomic Scale Interaction Among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O, A.B. Tesfamichael, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, We employed a combination of ab-initio calculations and statistical mechanical models to understand the nature of atomic scale interaction among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O. Because of the profound nature of the interaction, we began our study by focusing only on the interaction of Nb with Sn in the absence of Cl and O. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we calculated: (1), binding energy of both vacant and interstitial of the super cell for both Nb and Sn atoms (2), rate of diffusion and re-evaporation upon transportation of Sn atom across z-axis from bulk Nb layer (3), electron transfer and electric field upon transportation of Sn atom both across z-axis and xy-plane from bulk Nb layer. Our calculation indicated 30-40% difference from experimental results. Therefore, we conclude that the presence of oxides is important and also Cl impurity can not not be avoided., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, N. Sitaraman, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, R.G. Farber, S.J. Sibener, R.D. Veit, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA, M. Liepe, J.T. Maniscalco, Cornell University (CLASSE), Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education, Ithaca, New York, USA, We develop and apply new tools to understand Nb surface chemistry and fundamental electronic processes using theoretical ab initio methods. We study the thermodynamics of impurities and hydrides in the near-surface region as well as their effect on the surface band gap. This makes it possible for experimentalists to relate changes in STM dI/dV measurements resulting from different preparations to changes in subsurface structure. We also calculate matrix elements for electron-impurity scattering in Nb for common impurities O, N, C, and H. By transforming these matrix elements into a Wannier function basis, we calculate lifetimes for a dense set of states on the Fermi surface and determine the mean free path as a function of impurity density.

To understand and to adapt these treatments for lower frequency, \beta < 1 cavities, two coaxial test cavities, one quarter-wave resonator (QWR) and one half-wave resonator (HWR), have been built and put through a systematic study of these new treatments to show the effectiveness of these treatments at different frequencies. These cavities are tested in their fundamental mode and several higher order modes to study the frequency dependence of new cavity treatments such as N2 doping and infusion.

Several models and experimental studies have been proposed and performed over the years to understand the origin of these anomalous losses but a general consensus on what these orgins are is yet to be established. In this contribution, we present the results from the RF tests of several 1.3 GHz single-cell cavities limited by the HFQS and tested using a variable input coupler. This allowed to maintain close to critical coupling even at high field and the data showed that the HFQS did not saturate and that in some cases a power dissipation of up to 200 W at 2 K could be sustained without quench., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, G. Ciovati, G. Cheng, E. Daly, G.V. Eremeev, J. Henry, R.A. Rimmer, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, ODU, Norfolk, Virginia, USA, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia, USA, Industrial application of SRF technology would favor the use of cryocoolers to conductively cool SRF cavities for particle accelerators, operating at or above 4.3 K. In order to achieve a lower surface resistance than Nb at 4.3 K, a superconductor with higher critical temperature should be used, whereas a metal with higher thermal conductivity than Nb should be used to conduct the heat to the cryocoolers. A standard 1.5 GHz bulk Nb single-cell cavity has been coated with a ~2 µm thick layer of Nb3Sn on the inner surface and with a 5 mm thick Cu layer on the outer surface for conduction cooled applications. The cavity performance has been measured at 4.3 K and 2.0 K in liquid He.

We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases, Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields. These results suggest that trapped vortices can contribute to the extended Q(H) rise observed on the SRF cavities., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, P. Garg, K.N. Solanki, Arizona State University, Tempe, USA, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA, NHMFL, Tallahassee, Florida, USA, Niobium is basis for all superconducting radio frequency cavities, a technology that accelerates charged particle beams to energy levels not possible by other means. When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities. The original production material came from Two vendors Tokyo Denkai Co., Ltd. (TD) and Ningxia Orient Tantalum Industry Co., Ltd. (OTIC/NX)). It was found TD niobium required a lower annealing temperature (900°C) to obtain satisfactory flux expulsion characteristics compared to NX which required a slightly higher annealing temperature (950°-975°C). In order to ensure the new TD material performed equivalent to the niobium produced 4 year before after 900°C annealing; each heat lot of niobium had its flux expulsion characteristics parametrized and custom thermal treatments developed for each lot. Subsequent pure heat lot 9 cell cavities were made and tested. We will look at the flux expulsion characteristics of each lot, and RF loss of the 9-cell cavities produced using the individual heat lots., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS/IN2P3, IJCLab, Orsay, France, Trapped residual magnetic flux is responsible of residual resistance degradation on superconducting materials used in SRF technologies.

A better understanding of its behaviour could help to develop a method of expelling trapped flux from the superconducting surface. Using a superconducting coil with ferrite core attached to a 3 GHz sample Niobium cavity fully immersed in liquid Helium, we were able to subject the cavity walls to unusually large magnetic fields (estimated > 150 mT) and create magnetic quenches. With Fluxgate sensors attached in three spatial directions inside the cavity, we were able to monitor the quench dynamics and extract parameters of the flux dynamics from the hysteretic behaviour of the measured fields resulting from the applied coil current.

The RF and mechanical design of the SSR2 cavities has been completed and satisfies the technical requirements. However, our resent results of the high RF power tests of fully dressed SSR1 cavities show considerably strong multipacting (MP), which took significant time to process. On the other hand, the new results of the tests of balloon cavity showed significant mitigation of MP. In this paper we present the results of the improved design of the SSR2 cavity, based on the balloon cavity concept. The electromagnetic design is presented, including RF parameter optimization, MP simulations, field asymmetry analysis, High Order Mode (HOM) calculations.

Radial deformation of cavity cells can be provided by a special chain or a rolling device with three rollers. The chain distributes the radial forces on the equator area around the cell. The rollers are moving radially in relation to the rotating cavity and provide an equator diameter reduction. Both devices have the contour close to the cell shape at the equator area. The required equator radius deviation depends on the tuning target and usually varies between (0.02…0.60) mm.

This furnace is currently used for interstitial hydrogen removal (10h00 @ 650 °C) of two type of cavities: 1) the whole series of 26 ESS 352 MHz spoke resonators equipped with their Ti LHe tank well, 2) some prototypes of ESS high beta and medium beta cavities. Up to know IPN Orsay VH2T2 (10h00 @ 650 °C) was successfully applied to more than 16 cavities. In this paper we will first report about these VH2T2 tests. Finally, we have just started testing nitrogen infusion and nitrogen doping processes on samples and 1.3 GHz cavities: the preliminary results will be discussed., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, L. Steder, D. Reschke, DESY, Hamburg, Germany, DESY is and was very active in R&D related to SRF cavities. Many single and nine cell cavities with different surface treatment histories were tested vertically. Results of these cold tests are accelerating gradient and quality factor of the cavities. Using the large number of available datasets the parameters of the 120°C bake procedure, which is applied to avoid high-field Q-slope, are analysed. The impact of different durations and temperatures on accelerating gradient, quality factor and residual resistance is studied in detail and is compared to results obtained with the recently proposed procedure of modified low temperature bake. For this procedure additional four hours at temperatures around 75°C are implemented before the standard bake at about 120°C. Since the claim is, that cavities treated with such a modified procedure achieve extra-ordinary large accelerating gradients it is a very interesting research field for the European XFEL continuous wave mode upgrade. For this purpose cavities with high quality factors are needed, but in addition large maximal accelerating fields are required to maintain high energies in the pulsed operation mode of the accelerator., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, K.N. Nii, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, We have been carrying out R&D on vertical electropolishing (VEP) technique to establish it as an alternate of the horizontal EP (HEP) technique used for the surface treatment of niobium (Nb) superconducting RF (SRF) cavities. We have earlier reported on a VEP parameter study for 1.3 GHz single and nine-cell Nb cavities. The optimized VEP parameters and a unique rotating cathode yielded uniform removal and a smooth surface in the single cell cavity. The unique cathode and a dual flow mechanism for acid circulation were applied to improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. The vertically electropolished single and nine cell cavities achieved the same RF performance as achieved after the HEP processes. We are making efforts to further improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. Here, we report on a VEP of the 1.3 GHz Nb nine-cell cavity at a higher cathode rotation speed of 50 rpm. The VEP results reveal that the speed could be considered for improving the uniformity in removal while maintaining the surface smoothness. Required improvements in the VEP facility and acid flow condition for achieving uniform EP and a smooth surface are also described., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, F. Furuta, D.J. Bicepresenter, A.C. Crawford, T.J. Ring, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, Electro-chemical Polishing (EP) is one of the key technologies of surface treatments for niobium superconducting cavities. We have established a single-cell scale horizontal electro-polishing facility at Fermilab and routinely processed the niobium cavities with the frequencies of 1.3 GHz to 3.9 GHz. The precise control of EP parameters, especially the temperatures of cavity outside wall, allows the uniform removal over the cell with the variation of ±15%.

Indeed, the mechanical polishing is fun-damental also in the superconducting thin film resonant cavities in which one of the main issues that limits the per-formances is the surface preparation. A promising vi-bro-tumbling technique is being studied and implemented with a possibility to replace or improve mechanical treat-ment steps (grinding, barrel polishing). The simplic-ity of the technology allows it to adapt to any cavity geom-etry, both for Nb and Cu materials. The presented work contains last results on 6 GHz cavities obtained at LNL-INFN, both Nb bulk and Cu cavities., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, K.N. Nii, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, Marui Galvanizing Co., Ltd. has been developing vertical electropolishing (VEP) technology for single and nine-cell niobium superconducting radio frequency cavities using a unique cathode namely Ninja cathode in collaboration with KEK. The VEP process usually results in non-uniform removal with a large asymmetry along the cavity length. In order to suppress the asymmetry in removal, we are making different approaches. Flipping of the cavity during the VEP process is one of the approaches applied so far. A unique VEP setup, which allows the flipping of a multi-cell cavity, has been developed as reported earlier. Here, we report the improvement in the setup with automation for cavity flipping. VEP experiments were conducted with the improved system. VEP parameters were studied and the VEP results including the removal trend are discussed in detail., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Y.I. Ida, V. Chouhan, K.N. Niipresenter, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, T. Akabori, G. Mitoya, K. Miyano, HKK, Morioka, Japan, Y. Anetai, F. Takahashi, WING. Co.Ltd, Iwate-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, M. Sawabe, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, The 1st report was delivered in May, 2018 at the IPAC 18 in Vancouver, Canada. The 2nd report was delivered in September, 2018 at the LINAC 18 in Beijing, China. We will make our 3rd report in July, 2019 at the SRF-19 in Dresden, Germany. There will be two main points this time. The first is that by using our improved Ninja Electrode Premium, we can out-perform our number one and number two competitors in terms of uniform electropolishing of the interior of the 9-cell cavity. The second point is that we can remove hydrogen gas, reacted during electropolishing, from the cavity chambers in a manner that has not been successfully achieved by 1st report, May 2018 and 2nd report, September 2018. We will report our 9-cell vertical polishing revolver-type unit that solves the above two problems., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, While the basic process of electropolishing niobium with 1:9 HF:H2SO4 electrolyte has been well characterized, the specific process parameters used to electropolish different superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity geometries requires thoughtful attention. One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization. In preparation for SNS PPU project, JLab performed some EP process development runs with SNS high beta cavities to help identify viable parameter regimes for communication to cavity vendors.

Developing the methods and tools for collecting and characterizing particles found in an accelerator enables process development towards field emission free SRF cavities. Methods are presented for sampling assemblies, components, processes, and environmental conditions utilizing forensic techniques with specialized tooling. Sampling activities to date have produced an inventory of over 850 GSR spindles. Traditional SEM + EDS analysis of this volume of spindles is challenged by labor investment, spindle sampling methods, and the subsequent data pipeline which ultimately results in a statically inadequate dataset for any particulate distribution characterization. A complete systematic analysis of the spindles is enabled by third party software controlling SEM automation for EDS data acquisition.

An R&D program has started at DESY, to prepare for a CW upgrade. Cryomodules are being tested in CW mode in our CryoModule Test Bench (CMTB) to study the performance and main issues for such an operation mode. Sensitivity to vibration causing microphonics is one of the main concerns for the CW operation in mode. Therefore a detailed analysis is being performed to evaluate the frequency spectrum of the EXFEL cryomodule main components: the cavity itself, the cavity string, the cold mass and the vacuum vessel. Finite Element Modal Analyses have been performed and the results compared with data measured at the CMTB.

The cavities have design loaded-Q of 4×107, which means that it has a control bandwidth of 16 Hz. The JLab prototype cryomodule was instrumented with a series of seven accelerometers, and impulse hammer response measurements were made while the cryomodule was being built and after it was installed in the JLab cryomodule test facility. This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz. Results of the modal analysis as well as the background microphonics observed when operated under various cryogenic conditions and with different modifications will be presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, B. Schriefer, W. Anders, A. Heugel, H. Hoffmann, G. Mielczarek, H. Stein, HZB, Berlin, Germany, In Berlin-Adlershof the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) is constructing the energy recovery linac ¿BERLinPro¿.

In this project, a new superconducting (SC) booster linac, so-called SRILAC, is being developed and constructed. The SRILAC consists of 10 TEM quarter-wavelength resonators made of pure niobium sheets which operate at 4 K. The target performance of each cavity is set as Q0 of 1×109 with its accelerating gradient of 6.8 MV/m. Recently we succeeded to develop high performance SC-cavities which satisfies the requirement with a wide margin. The cryomodule assembly is under way, and installation of cryomodules and He liquefaction system will be completed by the end of FY2018. The cooling-down test is scheduled in the Q1 of FY2019.

These modules are based on the ELBE modules of the Helmholtz Center Dresden-Rossendorf but are modified to suit the high current and energy-recovering operation at MESA. The energy gain per module per turn should be 25 MeV, provided by two TESLA cavities, which were vertically tested at DESY, Hamburg, Germany. These tests showed an excellent performance of the quench limit and quality factor for three out of the four cavities. The fourth cavity has a lower but still acceptable quench limit and quality factor. In order to validate the performance of the fully assembled cryomodules after delivery to Mainz a test stand has been set up at the Helmholtz Institut Mainz.

The measurements were performed for fully assembled cavities as well as for bare niobium cavities without the titanium jacket. In the procedure, the instantaneous resonant frequencies were measured for 10 seconds at a time interval of 1 ms and were recorded as a time series. The frequencies were analyzed by means of conventional signal analysis. The power spectrum was deduced from the autocorrelation function calculated with the fluctuation of resonant frequencies. Although the vibration amplitudes were smaller in the cavities assembled with the titanium jacket, we could not find a clear reason for this., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Ab-initio Study of Atomic Scale Interaction Among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O, A.B. Tesfamichael, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, We employed a combination of ab-initio calculations and statistical mechanical models to understand the nature of atomic scale interaction among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O. Because of the profound nature of the interaction, we began our study by focusing only on the interaction of Nb with Sn in the absence of Cl and O. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we calculated: (1), binding energy of both vacant and interstitial of the super cell for both Nb and Sn atoms (2), rate of diffusion and re-evaporation upon transportation of Sn atom across z-axis from bulk Nb layer (3), electron transfer and electric field upon transportation of Sn atom both across z-axis and xy-plane from bulk Nb layer. Our calculation indicated 30-40% difference from experimental results.

We study the thermodynamics of impurities and hydrides in the near-surface region as well as their effect on the surface band gap. This makes it possible for experimentalists to relate changes in STM dI/dV measurements resulting from different preparations to changes in subsurface structure. We also calculate matrix elements for electron-impurity scattering in Nb for common impurities O, N, C, and H. By transforming these matrix elements into a Wannier function basis, we calculate lifetimes for a dense set of states on the Fermi surface and determine the mean free path as a function of impurity density.

Several models and experimental studies have been proposed and performed over the years to understand the origin of these anomalous losses but a general consensus on what these orgins are is yet to be established. In this contribution, we present the results from the RF tests of several 1.3 GHz single-cell cavities limited by the HFQS and tested using a variable input coupler. This allowed to maintain close to critical coupling even at high field and the data showed that the HFQS did not saturate and that in some cases a power dissipation of up to 200 W at 2 K could be sustained without quench., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, G. Ciovati, G. Cheng, E. Daly, G.V. Eremeev, J. Henry, R.A. Rimmer, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, ODU, Norfolk, Virginia, USA, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia, USA, Industrial application of SRF technology would favor the use of cryocoolers to conductively cool SRF cavities for particle accelerators, operating at or above 4.3 K. In order to achieve a lower surface resistance than Nb at 4.3 K, a superconductor with higher critical temperature should be used, whereas a metal with higher thermal conductivity than Nb should be used to conduct the heat to the cryocoolers. A standard 1.5 GHz bulk Nb single-cell cavity has been coated with a ~2 µm thick layer of Nb3Sn on the inner surface and with a 5 mm thick Cu layer on the outer surface for conduction cooled applications. The cavity performance has been measured at 4.3 K and 2.0 K in liquid He. The cavity reached a peak surface magnetic field of ~40 mT with a quality factor of 6×109 and 3.5×109 at 4.3 K, before and after applying the thick Cu layer, respectively., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, J.T. Maniscalco, T. Gruber, A.T. Holic, M. Liepe, Cornell University (CLASSE), Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education, Ithaca, New York, USA, The Cornell DC Field Dependence Cavity is a new coaxial test resonator designed to study the impact of strong (up to 200 mT or more) DC surface magnetic fields on the superconducting surface resistance, providing physical insight into the root of the ‘‘anti-Q-slope’’ and probing critical fields.

Here we report extensive numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under the strong rf magnetic field. The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force. We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases, Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities. The original production material came from Two vendors Tokyo Denkai Co., Ltd. (TD) and Ningxia Orient Tantalum Industry Co., Ltd. (OTIC/NX)). It was found TD niobium required a lower annealing temperature (900°C) to obtain satisfactory flux expulsion characteristics compared to NX which required a slightly higher annealing temperature (950°-975°C). In order to ensure the new TD material performed equivalent to the niobium produced 4 year before after 900°C annealing; each heat lot of niobium had its flux expulsion characteristics parametrized and custom thermal treatments developed for each lot.

Radial deformation of cavity cells can be provided by a special chain or a rolling device with three rollers. The chain distributes the radial forces on the equator area around the cell. The rollers are moving radially in relation to the rotating cavity and provide an equator diameter reduction. Both devices have the contour close to the cell shape at the equator area. The required equator radius deviation depends on the tuning target and usually varies between (0.02…0.60) mm.

   Title: Statistical Analysis of the 120°C Bake Procedure of Superconducting Radio Frequency Cavities
   Authors: L. Steder, D. Reschke, DESY, Hamburg, Germany, DESY is and was very active in R&D related to SRF cavities. Many single and nine cell cavities with different surface treatment histories were tested vertically. Results of these cold tests are accelerating gradient and quality factor of the cavities. Using the large number of available datasets the parameters of the 120°C bake procedure, which is applied to avoid high-field Q-slope, are analysed. The impact of different durations and temperatures on accelerating gradient, quality factor and residual resistance is studied in detail and is compared to results obtained with the recently proposed procedure of modified low temperature bake. For this procedure additional four hours at temperatures around 75°C are implemented before the standard bake at about 120°C. Since the claim is, that cavities treated with such a modified procedure achieve extra-ordinary large accelerating gradients it is a very interesting research field for the European XFEL continuous wave mode upgrade. For this purpose cavities with high quality factors are needed, but in addition large maximal accelerating fields are required to maintain high energies in the pulsed operation mode of the accelerator., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, K.N. Nii, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, We have been carrying out R&D on vertical electropolishing (VEP) technique to establish it as an alternate of the horizontal EP (HEP) technique used for the surface treatment of niobium (Nb) superconducting RF (SRF) cavities. We have earlier reported on a VEP parameter study for 1.3 GHz single and nine-cell Nb cavities. The optimized VEP parameters and a unique rotating cathode yielded uniform removal and a smooth surface in the single cell cavity. The unique cathode and a dual flow mechanism for acid circulation were applied to improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. The vertically electropolished single and nine cell cavities achieved the same RF performance as achieved after the HEP processes. We are making efforts to further improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. Here, we report on a VEP of the 1.3 GHz Nb nine-cell cavity at a higher cathode rotation speed of 50 rpm. The VEP results reveal that the speed could be considered for improving the uniformity in removal while maintaining the surface smoothness. Required improvements in the VEP facility and acid flow condition for achieving uniform EP and a smooth surface are also described., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, F. Furuta, D.J. Bicepresenter, A.C. Crawford, T.J. Ring, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, Electro-chemical Polishing (EP) is one of the key technologies of surface treatments for niobium superconducting cavities. We have established a single-cell scale horizontal electro-polishing facility at Fermilab and routinely processed the niobium cavities with the frequencies of 1.3 GHz to 3.9 GHz. The precise control of EP parameters, especially the temperatures of cavity outside wall, allows the uniform removal over the cell with the variation of ±15%.

Indeed, the mechanical polishing is fun-damental also in the superconducting thin film resonant cavities in which one of the main issues that limits the per-formances is the surface preparation. A promising vi-bro-tumbling technique is being studied and implemented with a possibility to replace or improve mechanical treat-ment steps (grinding, barrel polishing). The simplic-ity of the technology allows it to adapt to any cavity geom-etry, both for Nb and Cu materials. The presented work contains last results on 6 GHz cavities obtained at LNL-INFN, both Nb bulk and Cu cavities., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, K.N. Nii, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, Marui Galvanizing Co., Ltd. has been developing vertical electropolishing (VEP) technology for single and nine-cell niobium superconducting radio frequency cavities using a unique cathode namely Ninja cathode in collaboration with KEK. The VEP process usually results in non-uniform removal with a large asymmetry along the cavity length. In order to suppress the asymmetry in removal, we are making different approaches. Flipping of the cavity during the VEP process is one of the approaches applied so far. A unique VEP setup, which allows the flipping of a multi-cell cavity, has been developed as reported earlier. Here, we report the improvement in the setup with automation for cavity flipping. VEP experiments were conducted with the improved system. VEP parameters were studied and the VEP results including the removal trend are discussed in detail., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Y.I. Ida, V. Chouhan, K.N. Niipresenter, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, T. Akabori, G. Mitoya, K. Miyano, HKK, Morioka, Japan, Y. Anetai, F. Takahashi, WING. Co.Ltd, Iwate-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, M. Sawabe, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, The 1st report was delivered in May, 2018 at the IPAC 18 in Vancouver, Canada. The 2nd report was delivered in September, 2018 at the LINAC 18 in Beijing, China. We will make our 3rd report in July, 2019 at the SRF-19 in Dresden, Germany. There will be two main points this time. The first is that by using our improved Ninja Electrode Premium, we can out-perform our number one and number two competitors in terms of uniform electropolishing of the interior of the 9-cell cavity. The second point is that we can remove hydrogen gas, reacted during electropolishing, from the cavity chambers in a manner that has not been successfully achieved by 1st report, May 2018 and 2nd report, September 2018. We will report our 9-cell vertical polishing revolver-type unit that solves the above two problems., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, While the basic process of electropolishing niobium with 1:9 HF:H2SO4 electrolyte has been well characterized, the specific process parameters used to electropolish different superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity geometries requires thoughtful attention. One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization. In preparation for SNS PPU project, JLab performed some EP process development runs with SNS high beta cavities to help identify viable parameter regimes for communication to cavity vendors.

Methods are presented for sampling assemblies, components, processes, and environmental conditions utilizing forensic techniques with specialized tooling. Sampling activities to date have produced an inventory of over 850 GSR spindles. Traditional SEM + EDS analysis of this volume of spindles is challenged by labor investment, spindle sampling methods, and the subsequent data pipeline which ultimately results in a statically inadequate dataset for any particulate distribution characterization.

An R&D program has started at DESY, to prepare for a CW upgrade. Cryomodules are being tested in CW mode in our CryoModule Test Bench (CMTB) to study the performance and main issues for such an operation mode. Sensitivity to vibration causing microphonics is one of the main concerns for the CW operation in mode. Therefore a detailed analysis is being performed to evaluate the frequency spectrum of the EXFEL cryomodule main components: the cavity itself, the cavity string, the cold mass and the vacuum vessel.

The cavities have design loaded-Q of 4×107, which means that it has a control bandwidth of 16 Hz. The JLab prototype cryomodule was instrumented with a series of seven accelerometers, and impulse hammer response measurements were made while the cryomodule was being built and after it was installed in the JLab cryomodule test facility. This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz. Results of the modal analysis as well as the background microphonics observed when operated under various cryogenic conditions and with different modifications will be presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, B. Schriefer, W. Anders, A. Heugel, H. Hoffmann, G. Mielczarek, H. Stein, HZB, Berlin, Germany, In Berlin-Adlershof the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) is constructing the energy recovery linac ¿BERLinPro¿.

Because of the profound nature of the interaction, we began our study by focusing only on the interaction of Nb with Sn in the absence of Cl and O. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we calculated: (1), binding energy of both vacant and interstitial of the super cell for both Nb and Sn atoms (2), rate of diffusion and re-evaporation upon transportation of Sn atom across z-axis from bulk Nb layer (3), electron transfer and electric field upon transportation of Sn atom both across z-axis and xy-plane from bulk Nb layer. Our calculation indicated 30-40% difference from experimental results. Therefore, we conclude that the presence of oxides is important and also Cl impurity can not not be avoided., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, N. Sitaraman, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, R.G. Farber, S.J. Sibener, R.D. Veit, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA, M. Liepe, J.T. Maniscalco, Cornell University (CLASSE), Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education, Ithaca, New York, USA, We develop and apply new tools to understand Nb surface chemistry and fundamental electronic processes using theoretical ab initio methods. We study the thermodynamics of impurities and hydrides in the near-surface region as well as their effect on the surface band gap. This makes it possible for experimentalists to relate changes in STM dI/dV measurements resulting from different preparations to changes in subsurface structure. We also calculate matrix elements for electron-impurity scattering in Nb for common impurities O, N, C, and H. By transforming these matrix elements into a Wannier function basis, we calculate lifetimes for a dense set of states on the Fermi surface and determine the mean free path as a function of impurity density.

Here we report extensive numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under the strong rf magnetic field. The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force. We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases, Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities.

It was found TD niobium required a lower annealing temperature (900°C) to obtain satisfactory flux expulsion characteristics compared to NX which required a slightly higher annealing temperature (950°-975°C). In order to ensure the new TD material performed equivalent to the niobium produced 4 year before after 900°C annealing; each heat lot of niobium had its flux expulsion characteristics parametrized and custom thermal treatments developed for each lot.

The rollers are moving radially in relation to the rotating cavity and provide an equator diameter reduction. Both devices have the contour close to the cell shape at the equator area.

   Title: Effect of Cathode Rotation and Acid Flow in Vertical Electropolishing of 1.3 GHz Niobium Nine-Cell Cavity
   Authors: V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, K.N. Nii, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, We have been carrying out R&D on vertical electropolishing (VEP) technique to establish it as an alternate of the horizontal EP (HEP) technique used for the surface treatment of niobium (Nb) superconducting RF (SRF) cavities. We have earlier reported on a VEP parameter study for 1.3 GHz single and nine-cell Nb cavities. The optimized VEP parameters and a unique rotating cathode yielded uniform removal and a smooth surface in the single cell cavity. The unique cathode and a dual flow mechanism for acid circulation were applied to improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. The vertically electropolished single and nine cell cavities achieved the same RF performance as achieved after the HEP processes. We are making efforts to further improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. Here, we report on a VEP of the 1.3 GHz Nb nine-cell cavity at a higher cathode rotation speed of 50 rpm. The VEP results reveal that the speed could be considered for improving the uniformity in removal while maintaining the surface smoothness. Required improvements in the VEP facility and acid flow condition for achieving uniform EP and a smooth surface are also described., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, F. Furuta, D.J. Bicepresenter, A.C. Crawford, T.J. Ring, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, Electro-chemical Polishing (EP) is one of the key technologies of surface treatments for niobium superconducting cavities. We have established a single-cell scale horizontal electro-polishing facility at Fermilab and routinely processed the niobium cavities with the frequencies of 1.3 GHz to 3.9 GHz. The precise control of EP parameters, especially the temperatures of cavity outside wall, allows the uniform removal over the cell with the variation of ±15%.

Indeed, the mechanical polishing is fun-damental also in the superconducting thin film resonant cavities in which one of the main issues that limits the per-formances is the surface preparation. A promising vi-bro-tumbling technique is being studied and implemented with a possibility to replace or improve mechanical treat-ment steps (grinding, barrel polishing). The simplic-ity of the technology allows it to adapt to any cavity geom-etry, both for Nb and Cu materials. The presented work contains last results on 6 GHz cavities obtained at LNL-INFN, both Nb bulk and Cu cavities., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, K.N. Nii, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, Marui Galvanizing Co., Ltd. has been developing vertical electropolishing (VEP) technology for single and nine-cell niobium superconducting radio frequency cavities using a unique cathode namely Ninja cathode in collaboration with KEK. The VEP process usually results in non-uniform removal with a large asymmetry along the cavity length. In order to suppress the asymmetry in removal, we are making different approaches. Flipping of the cavity during the VEP process is one of the approaches applied so far. A unique VEP setup, which allows the flipping of a multi-cell cavity, has been developed as reported earlier. Here, we report the improvement in the setup with automation for cavity flipping. VEP experiments were conducted with the improved system. VEP parameters were studied and the VEP results including the removal trend are discussed in detail., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Y.I. Ida, V. Chouhan, K.N. Niipresenter, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, T. Akabori, G. Mitoya, K. Miyano, HKK, Morioka, Japan, Y. Anetai, F. Takahashi, WING. Co.Ltd, Iwate-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, M. Sawabe, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, The 1st report was delivered in May, 2018 at the IPAC 18 in Vancouver, Canada. The 2nd report was delivered in September, 2018 at the LINAC 18 in Beijing, China. We will make our 3rd report in July, 2019 at the SRF-19 in Dresden, Germany. There will be two main points this time. The first is that by using our improved Ninja Electrode Premium, we can out-perform our number one and number two competitors in terms of uniform electropolishing of the interior of the 9-cell cavity. The second point is that we can remove hydrogen gas, reacted during electropolishing, from the cavity chambers in a manner that has not been successfully achieved by 1st report, May 2018 and 2nd report, September 2018. We will report our 9-cell vertical polishing revolver-type unit that solves the above two problems., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, While the basic process of electropolishing niobium with 1:9 HF:H2SO4 electrolyte has been well characterized, the specific process parameters used to electropolish different superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity geometries requires thoughtful attention. One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization. In preparation for SNS PPU project, JLab performed some EP process development runs with SNS high beta cavities to help identify viable parameter regimes for communication to cavity vendors.

An R&D program has started at DESY, to prepare for a CW upgrade. Cryomodules are being tested in CW mode in our CryoModule Test Bench (CMTB) to study the performance and main issues for such an operation mode. Sensitivity to vibration causing microphonics is one of the main concerns for the CW operation in mode. Therefore a detailed analysis is being performed to evaluate the frequency spectrum of the EXFEL cryomodule main components: the cavity itself, the cavity string, the cold mass and the vacuum vessel.

The cavities have design loaded-Q of 4×107, which means that it has a control bandwidth of 16 Hz. The JLab prototype cryomodule was instrumented with a series of seven accelerometers, and impulse hammer response measurements were made while the cryomodule was being built and after it was installed in the JLab cryomodule test facility. This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz.

These modules are based on the ELBE modules of the Helmholtz Center Dresden-Rossendorf but are modified to suit the high current and energy-recovering operation at MESA. The energy gain per module per turn should be 25 MeV, provided by two TESLA cavities, which were vertically tested at DESY, Hamburg, Germany. These tests showed an excellent performance of the quench limit and quality factor for three out of the four cavities. The fourth cavity has a lower but still acceptable quench limit and quality factor. In order to validate the performance of the fully assembled cryomodules after delivery to Mainz a test stand has been set up at the Helmholtz Institut Mainz. The test stand is described in detail and the status of the module testing is reported., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, O. Kamigaito, K. Ozeki, N. Sakamoto, K. Suda, K. Yamada, RIKEN Nishina Center, Wako, Japan, Mechanical vibration of quarter-wavelength resonators of SRILAC, the superconducting booster of the RIKEN heavy-ion linac, was measured during a vertical cold test. The measurements were performed for fully assembled cavities as well as for bare niobium cavities without the titanium jacket. In the procedure, the instantaneous resonant frequencies were measured for 10 seconds at a time interval of 1 ms and were recorded as a time series. The frequencies were analyzed by means of conventional signal analysis. The power spectrum was deduced from the autocorrelation function calculated with the fluctuation of resonant frequencies. Although the vibration amplitudes were smaller in the cavities assembled with the titanium jacket, we could not find a clear reason for this., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Ab-initio Study of Atomic Scale Interaction Among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O, A.B. Tesfamichael, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, We employed a combination of ab-initio calculations and statistical mechanical models to understand the nature of atomic scale interaction among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O. Because of the profound nature of the interaction, we began our study by focusing only on the interaction of Nb with Sn in the absence of Cl and O. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we calculated: (1), binding energy of both vacant and interstitial of the super cell for both Nb and Sn atoms (2), rate of diffusion and re-evaporation upon transportation of Sn atom across z-axis from bulk Nb layer (3), electron transfer and electric field upon transportation of Sn atom both across z-axis and xy-plane from bulk Nb layer. Our calculation indicated 30-40% difference from experimental results. Therefore, we conclude that the presence of oxides is important and also Cl impurity can not not be avoided., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, N. Sitaraman, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, R.G. Farber, S.J. Sibener, R.D. Veit, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA, M. Liepe, J.T. Maniscalco, Cornell University (CLASSE), Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education, Ithaca, New York, USA, We develop and apply new tools to understand Nb surface chemistry and fundamental electronic processes using theoretical ab initio methods. We study the thermodynamics of impurities and hydrides in the near-surface region as well as their effect on the surface band gap. This makes it possible for experimentalists to relate changes in STM dI/dV measurements resulting from different preparations to changes in subsurface structure. We also calculate matrix elements for electron-impurity scattering in Nb for common impurities O, N, C, and H. By transforming these matrix elements into a Wannier function basis, we calculate lifetimes for a dense set of states on the Fermi surface and determine the mean free path as a function of impurity density.

Several models and experimental studies have been proposed and performed over the years to understand the origin of these anomalous losses but a general consensus on what these orgins are is yet to be established. In this contribution, we present the results from the RF tests of several 1.3 GHz single-cell cavities limited by the HFQS and tested using a variable input coupler.

In order to achieve a lower surface resistance than Nb at 4.3 K, a superconductor with higher critical temperature should be used, whereas a metal with higher thermal conductivity than Nb should be used to conduct the heat to the cryocoolers.

Here we report extensive numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under the strong rf magnetic field. The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force. We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases, Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities.

It was found TD niobium required a lower annealing temperature (900°C) to obtain satisfactory flux expulsion characteristics compared to NX which required a slightly higher annealing temperature (950°-975°C). In order to ensure the new TD material performed equivalent to the niobium produced 4 year before after 900°C annealing; each heat lot of niobium had its flux expulsion characteristics parametrized and custom thermal treatments developed for each lot.

Radial deformation of cavity cells can be provided by a special chain or a rolling device with three rollers. The chain distributes the radial forces on the equator area around the cell. The rollers are moving radially in relation to the rotating cavity and provide an equator diameter reduction. Both devices have the contour close to the cell shape at the equator area.

   Title: Fermilab EP Facility Improvement
   Authors: F. Furuta, D.J. Bicepresenter, A.C. Crawford, T.J. Ring, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, Electro-chemical Polishing (EP) is one of the key technologies of surface treatments for niobium superconducting cavities. We have established a single-cell scale horizontal electro-polishing facility at Fermilab and routinely processed the niobium cavities with the frequencies of 1.3 GHz to 3.9 GHz. The precise control of EP parameters, especially the temperatures of cavity outside wall, allows the uniform removal over the cell with the variation of ±15%. Here we report the details of our EP process and recent improvements on our EP facility at Fermilab., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, A. Sulimov, J.H. Thie, DESY, Hamburg, Germany, Ettore Zanon S.p.A., Nuclear Division, Schio, Italy, RI Research Instruments GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, A. Sulimov, J.H. Thie, DESY, Hamburg, Germany, ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, E. Chyhyrynets, O. Azzolini, V.A. Garcia, G. Keppel, C. Pirapresenter, F. Stivanello, L. Zanotto, INFN/LNL, Legnaro (PD), Italy, Centrifugal Barrel Polishing (CBP) is a common tool in the Nb bulk SC cavities production, prior to elec-tropolishing (EP). Indeed, the mechanical polishing is fun-damental also in the superconducting thin film resonant cavities in which one of the main issues that limits the per-formances is the surface preparation. A promising vi-bro-tumbling technique is being studied and implemented with a possibility to replace or improve mechanical treat-ment steps (grinding, barrel polishing). The simplic-ity of the technology allows it to adapt to any cavity geom-etry, both for Nb and Cu materials. The presented work contains last results on 6 GHz cavities obtained at LNL-INFN, both Nb bulk and Cu cavities., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, K.N. Nii, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, Marui Galvanizing Co., Ltd. has been developing vertical electropolishing (VEP) technology for single and nine-cell niobium superconducting radio frequency cavities using a unique cathode namely Ninja cathode in collaboration with KEK. The VEP process usually results in non-uniform removal with a large asymmetry along the cavity length. In order to suppress the asymmetry in removal, we are making different approaches. Flipping of the cavity during the VEP process is one of the approaches applied so far. A unique VEP setup, which allows the flipping of a multi-cell cavity, has been developed as reported earlier. Here, we report the improvement in the setup with automation for cavity flipping. VEP experiments were conducted with the improved system. VEP parameters were studied and the VEP results including the removal trend are discussed in detail., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Y.I. Ida, V. Chouhan, K.N. Niipresenter, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, T. Akabori, G. Mitoya, K. Miyano, HKK, Morioka, Japan, Y. Anetai, F. Takahashi, WING. Co.Ltd, Iwate-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, M. Sawabe, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, The 1st report was delivered in May, 2018 at the IPAC 18 in Vancouver, Canada. The 2nd report was delivered in September, 2018 at the LINAC 18 in Beijing, China. We will make our 3rd report in July, 2019 at the SRF-19 in Dresden, Germany. There will be two main points this time. The first is that by using our improved Ninja Electrode Premium, we can out-perform our number one and number two competitors in terms of uniform electropolishing of the interior of the 9-cell cavity. The second point is that we can remove hydrogen gas, reacted during electropolishing, from the cavity chambers in a manner that has not been successfully achieved by 1st report, May 2018 and 2nd report, September 2018. We will report our 9-cell vertical polishing revolver-type unit that solves the above two problems., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, While the basic process of electropolishing niobium with 1:9 HF:H2SO4 electrolyte has been well characterized, the specific process parameters used to electropolish different superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity geometries requires thoughtful attention. One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization. In preparation for SNS PPU project, JLab performed some EP process development runs with SNS high beta cavities to help identify viable parameter regimes for communication to cavity vendors.

An R&D program has started at DESY, to prepare for a CW upgrade. Cryomodules are being tested in CW mode in our CryoModule Test Bench (CMTB) to study the performance and main issues for such an operation mode. Sensitivity to vibration causing microphonics is one of the main concerns for the CW operation in mode. Therefore a detailed analysis is being performed to evaluate the frequency spectrum of the EXFEL cryomodule main components: the cavity itself, the cavity string, the cold mass and the vacuum vessel.

The cavities have design loaded-Q of 4×107, which means that it has a control bandwidth of 16 Hz. The JLab prototype cryomodule was instrumented with a series of seven accelerometers, and impulse hammer response measurements were made while the cryomodule was being built and after it was installed in the JLab cryomodule test facility. This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz.

Recently we succeeded to develop high performance SC-cavities which satisfies the requirement with a wide margin. The cryomodule assembly is under way, and installation of cryomodules and He liquefaction system will be completed by the end of FY2018. The cooling-down test is scheduled in the Q1 of FY2019.

These modules are based on the ELBE modules of the Helmholtz Center Dresden-Rossendorf but are modified to suit the high current and energy-recovering operation at MESA. The energy gain per module per turn should be 25 MeV, provided by two TESLA cavities, which were vertically tested at DESY, Hamburg, Germany. These tests showed an excellent performance of the quench limit and quality factor for three out of the four cavities. The fourth cavity has a lower but still acceptable quench limit and quality factor. In order to validate the performance of the fully assembled cryomodules after delivery to Mainz a test stand has been set up at the Helmholtz Institut Mainz. The test stand is described in detail and the status of the module testing is reported., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, O. Kamigaito, K. Ozeki, N. Sakamoto, K. Suda, K. Yamada, RIKEN Nishina Center, Wako, Japan, Mechanical vibration of quarter-wavelength resonators of SRILAC, the superconducting booster of the RIKEN heavy-ion linac, was measured during a vertical cold test. The measurements were performed for fully assembled cavities as well as for bare niobium cavities without the titanium jacket. In the procedure, the instantaneous resonant frequencies were measured for 10 seconds at a time interval of 1 ms and were recorded as a time series. The frequencies were analyzed by means of conventional signal analysis. The power spectrum was deduced from the autocorrelation function calculated with the fluctuation of resonant frequencies. Although the vibration amplitudes were smaller in the cavities assembled with the titanium jacket, we could not find a clear reason for this., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Ab-initio Study of Atomic Scale Interaction Among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O, A.B. Tesfamichael, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, We employed a combination of ab-initio calculations and statistical mechanical models to understand the nature of atomic scale interaction among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O. Because of the profound nature of the interaction, we began our study by focusing only on the interaction of Nb with Sn in the absence of Cl and O. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we calculated: (1), binding energy of both vacant and interstitial of the super cell for both Nb and Sn atoms (2), rate of diffusion and re-evaporation upon transportation of Sn atom across z-axis from bulk Nb layer (3), electron transfer and electric field upon transportation of Sn atom both across z-axis and xy-plane from bulk Nb layer. Our calculation indicated 30-40% difference from experimental results. Therefore, we conclude that the presence of oxides is important and also Cl impurity can not not be avoided., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, N. Sitaraman, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, R.G. Farber, S.J. Sibener, R.D. Veit, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA, M. Liepe, J.T. Maniscalco, Cornell University (CLASSE), Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education, Ithaca, New York, USA, We develop and apply new tools to understand Nb surface chemistry and fundamental electronic processes using theoretical ab initio methods. We study the thermodynamics of impurities and hydrides in the near-surface region as well as their effect on the surface band gap. This makes it possible for experimentalists to relate changes in STM dI/dV measurements resulting from different preparations to changes in subsurface structure. We also calculate matrix elements for electron-impurity scattering in Nb for common impurities O, N, C, and H. By transforming these matrix elements into a Wannier function basis, we calculate lifetimes for a dense set of states on the Fermi surface and determine the mean free path as a function of impurity density.

Several models and experimental studies have been proposed and performed over the years to understand the origin of these anomalous losses but a general consensus on what these orgins are is yet to be established. In this contribution, we present the results from the RF tests of several 1.3 GHz single-cell cavities limited by the HFQS and tested using a variable input coupler. This allowed to maintain close to critical coupling even at high field and the data showed that the HFQS did not saturate and that in some cases a power dissipation of up to 200 W at 2 K could be sustained without quench., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, G. Ciovati, G. Cheng, E. Daly, G.V. Eremeev, J. Henry, R.A. Rimmer, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, ODU, Norfolk, Virginia, USA, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia, USA, Industrial application of SRF technology would favor the use of cryocoolers to conductively cool SRF cavities for particle accelerators, operating at or above 4.3 K. In order to achieve a lower surface resistance than Nb at 4.3 K, a superconductor with higher critical temperature should be used, whereas a metal with higher thermal conductivity than Nb should be used to conduct the heat to the cryocoolers. A standard 1.5 GHz bulk Nb single-cell cavity has been coated with a ~2 µm thick layer of Nb3Sn on the inner surface and with a 5 mm thick Cu layer on the outer surface for conduction cooled applications. The cavity performance has been measured at 4.3 K and 2.0 K in liquid He.

Here we report extensive numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under the strong rf magnetic field. The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force. We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases, Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities. The original production material came from Two vendors Tokyo Denkai Co., Ltd. (TD) and Ningxia Orient Tantalum Industry Co., Ltd. (OTIC/NX)). It was found TD niobium required a lower annealing temperature (900°C) to obtain satisfactory flux expulsion characteristics compared to NX which required a slightly higher annealing temperature (950°-975°C). In order to ensure the new TD material performed equivalent to the niobium produced 4 year before after 900°C annealing; each heat lot of niobium had its flux expulsion characteristics parametrized and custom thermal treatments developed for each lot. Subsequent pure heat lot 9 cell cavities were made and tested.

   Institutions: Experience of LCLS-II Cavities Radial Tuning at DESY; Radial tuning devices at DESY can be applied to any TESLA shape 1.3 GHz cavity to reduce its elongation due to excessive additional material removal (>300 µm) or to compensate critical manufacturing uncertainties. Radial deformation of cavity cells can be provided by a special chain or a rolling device with three rollers. The chain distributes the radial forces on the equator area around the cell. The rollers are moving radially in relation to the rotating cavity and provide an equator diameter reduction. Both devices have the contour close to the cell shape at the equator area. The required equator radius deviation depends on the tuning target and usually varies between (0.02…0.60) mm.

Indeed, the mechanical polishing is fun-damental also in the superconducting thin film resonant cavities in which one of the main issues that limits the per-formances is the surface preparation. A promising vi-bro-tumbling technique is being studied and implemented with a possibility to replace or improve mechanical treat-ment steps (grinding, barrel polishing). The simplic-ity of the technology allows it to adapt to any cavity geom-etry, both for Nb and Cu materials. The presented work contains last results on 6 GHz cavities obtained at LNL-INFN, both Nb bulk and Cu cavities., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, K.N. Nii, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, Marui Galvanizing Co., Ltd. has been developing vertical electropolishing (VEP) technology for single and nine-cell niobium superconducting radio frequency cavities using a unique cathode namely Ninja cathode in collaboration with KEK. The VEP process usually results in non-uniform removal with a large asymmetry along the cavity length. In order to suppress the asymmetry in removal, we are making different approaches. Flipping of the cavity during the VEP process is one of the approaches applied so far. A unique VEP setup, which allows the flipping of a multi-cell cavity, has been developed as reported earlier. Here, we report the improvement in the setup with automation for cavity flipping. VEP experiments were conducted with the improved system. VEP parameters were studied and the VEP results including the removal trend are discussed in detail., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Y.I. Ida, V. Chouhan, K.N. Niipresenter, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, T. Akabori, G. Mitoya, K. Miyano, HKK, Morioka, Japan, Y. Anetai, F. Takahashi, WING. Co.Ltd, Iwate-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, M. Sawabe, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, The 1st report was delivered in May, 2018 at the IPAC 18 in Vancouver, Canada. The 2nd report was delivered in September, 2018 at the LINAC 18 in Beijing, China. We will make our 3rd report in July, 2019 at the SRF-19 in Dresden, Germany. There will be two main points this time. The first is that by using our improved Ninja Electrode Premium, we can out-perform our number one and number two competitors in terms of uniform electropolishing of the interior of the 9-cell cavity. The second point is that we can remove hydrogen gas, reacted during electropolishing, from the cavity chambers in a manner that has not been successfully achieved by 1st report, May 2018 and 2nd report, September 2018. We will report our 9-cell vertical polishing revolver-type unit that solves the above two problems., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, While the basic process of electropolishing niobium with 1:9 HF:H2SO4 electrolyte has been well characterized, the specific process parameters used to electropolish different superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity geometries requires thoughtful attention. One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization. In preparation for SNS PPU project, JLab performed some EP process development runs with SNS high beta cavities to help identify viable parameter regimes for communication to cavity vendors.

An R&D program has started at DESY, to prepare for a CW upgrade. Cryomodules are being tested in CW mode in our CryoModule Test Bench (CMTB) to study the performance and main issues for such an operation mode.

The cavities have design loaded-Q of 4×107, which means that it has a control bandwidth of 16 Hz. The JLab prototype cryomodule was instrumented with a series of seven accelerometers, and impulse hammer response measurements were made while the cryomodule was being built and after it was installed in the JLab cryomodule test facility. This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz.

These modules are based on the ELBE modules of the Helmholtz Center Dresden-Rossendorf but are modified to suit the high current and energy-recovering operation at MESA. The energy gain per module per turn should be 25 MeV, provided by two TESLA cavities, which were vertically tested at DESY, Hamburg, Germany. These tests showed an excellent performance of the quench limit and quality factor for three out of the four cavities. The fourth cavity has a lower but still acceptable quench limit and quality factor. In order to validate the performance of the fully assembled cryomodules after delivery to Mainz a test stand has been set up at the Helmholtz Institut Mainz.

The measurements were performed for fully assembled cavities as well as for bare niobium cavities without the titanium jacket. In the procedure, the instantaneous resonant frequencies were measured for 10 seconds at a time interval of 1 ms and were recorded as a time series. The frequencies were analyzed by means of conventional signal analysis. The power spectrum was deduced from the autocorrelation function calculated with the fluctuation of resonant frequencies. Although the vibration amplitudes were smaller in the cavities assembled with the titanium jacket, we could not find a clear reason for this., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Ab-initio Study of Atomic Scale Interaction Among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O, A.B. Tesfamichael, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, We employed a combination of ab-initio calculations and statistical mechanical models to understand the nature of atomic scale interaction among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O. Because of the profound nature of the interaction, we began our study by focusing only on the interaction of Nb with Sn in the absence of Cl and O. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we calculated: (1), binding energy of both vacant and interstitial of the super cell for both Nb and Sn atoms (2), rate of diffusion and re-evaporation upon transportation of Sn atom across z-axis from bulk Nb layer (3), electron transfer and electric field upon transportation of Sn atom both across z-axis and xy-plane from bulk Nb layer. Our calculation indicated 30-40% difference from experimental results. Therefore, we conclude that the presence of oxides is important and also Cl impurity can not not be avoided., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, N. Sitaraman, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, R.G. Farber, S.J. Sibener, R.D. Veit, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA, M. Liepe, J.T. Maniscalco, Cornell University (CLASSE), Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education, Ithaca, New York, USA, We develop and apply new tools to understand Nb surface chemistry and fundamental electronic processes using theoretical ab initio methods. We study the thermodynamics of impurities and hydrides in the near-surface region as well as their effect on the surface band gap. This makes it possible for experimentalists to relate changes in STM dI/dV measurements resulting from different preparations to changes in subsurface structure. We also calculate matrix elements for electron-impurity scattering in Nb for common impurities O, N, C, and H. By transforming these matrix elements into a Wannier function basis, we calculate lifetimes for a dense set of states on the Fermi surface and determine the mean free path as a function of impurity density.

Several models and experimental studies have been proposed and performed over the years to understand the origin of these anomalous losses but a general consensus on what these orgins are is yet to be established. In this contribution, we present the results from the RF tests of several 1.3 GHz single-cell cavities limited by the HFQS and tested using a variable input coupler. This allowed to maintain close to critical coupling even at high field and the data showed that the HFQS did not saturate and that in some cases a power dissipation of up to 200 W at 2 K could be sustained without quench., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, G. Ciovati, G. Cheng, E. Daly, G.V. Eremeev, J. Henry, R.A. Rimmer, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, ODU, Norfolk, Virginia, USA, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia, USA, Industrial application of SRF technology would favor the use of cryocoolers to conductively cool SRF cavities for particle accelerators, operating at or above 4.3 K. In order to achieve a lower surface resistance than Nb at 4.3 K, a superconductor with higher critical temperature should be used, whereas a metal with higher thermal conductivity than Nb should be used to conduct the heat to the cryocoolers. A standard 1.5 GHz bulk Nb single-cell cavity has been coated with a ~2 µm thick layer of Nb3Sn on the inner surface and with a 5 mm thick Cu layer on the outer surface for conduction cooled applications. The cavity performance has been measured at 4.3 K and 2.0 K in liquid He.

Here we report extensive numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under the strong rf magnetic field. The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force. We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases, Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities. The original production material came from Two vendors Tokyo Denkai Co., Ltd. (TD) and Ningxia Orient Tantalum Industry Co., Ltd. (OTIC/NX)). It was found TD niobium required a lower annealing temperature (900°C) to obtain satisfactory flux expulsion characteristics compared to NX which required a slightly higher annealing temperature (950°-975°C). In order to ensure the new TD material performed equivalent to the niobium produced 4 year before after 900°C annealing; each heat lot of niobium had its flux expulsion characteristics parametrized and custom thermal treatments developed for each lot.

   Institutions: Radial tuning devices at DESY can be applied to any TESLA shape 1.3 GHz cavity to reduce its elongation due to excessive additional material removal (>300 µm) or to compensate critical manufacturing uncertainties. Radial deformation of cavity cells can be provided by a special chain or a rolling device with three rollers. The chain distributes the radial forces on the equator area around the cell. The rollers are moving radially in relation to the rotating cavity and provide an equator diameter reduction. Both devices have the contour close to the cell shape at the equator area. The required equator radius deviation depends on the tuning target and usually varies between (0.02…0.60) mm.

Indeed, the mechanical polishing is fun-damental also in the superconducting thin film resonant cavities in which one of the main issues that limits the per-formances is the surface preparation. A promising vi-bro-tumbling technique is being studied and implemented with a possibility to replace or improve mechanical treat-ment steps (grinding, barrel polishing). The simplic-ity of the technology allows it to adapt to any cavity geom-etry, both for Nb and Cu materials.

The VEP process usually results in non-uniform removal with a large asymmetry along the cavity length. In order to suppress the asymmetry in removal, we are making different approaches. Flipping of the cavity during the VEP process is one of the approaches applied so far. A unique VEP setup, which allows the flipping of a multi-cell cavity, has been developed as reported earlier. Here, we report the improvement in the setup with automation for cavity flipping. VEP experiments were conducted with the improved system.

The 2nd report was delivered in September, 2018 at the LINAC 18 in Beijing, China. We will make our 3rd report in July, 2019 at the SRF-19 in Dresden, Germany. There will be two main points this time. The first is that by using our improved Ninja Electrode Premium, we can out-perform our number one and number two competitors in terms of uniform electropolishing of the interior of the 9-cell cavity. The second point is that we can remove hydrogen gas, reacted during electropolishing, from the cavity chambers in a manner that has not been successfully achieved by 1st report, May 2018 and 2nd report, September 2018. We will report our 9-cell vertical polishing revolver-type unit that solves the above two problems., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, While the basic process of electropolishing niobium with 1:9 HF:H2SO4 electrolyte has been well characterized, the specific process parameters used to electropolish different superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity geometries requires thoughtful attention. One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization. In preparation for SNS PPU project, JLab performed some EP process development runs with SNS high beta cavities to help identify viable parameter regimes for communication to cavity vendors.

The JLab prototype cryomodule was instrumented with a series of seven accelerometers, and impulse hammer response measurements were made while the cryomodule was being built and after it was installed in the JLab cryomodule test facility.

These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation.

The measurements were performed for fully assembled cavities as well as for bare niobium cavities without the titanium jacket. In the procedure, the instantaneous resonant frequencies were measured for 10 seconds at a time interval of 1 ms and were recorded as a time series. The frequencies were analyzed by means of conventional signal analysis. The power spectrum was deduced from the autocorrelation function calculated with the fluctuation of resonant frequencies.

Because of the profound nature of the interaction, we began our study by focusing only on the interaction of Nb with Sn in the absence of Cl and O. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we calculated: (1), binding energy of both vacant and interstitial of the super cell for both Nb and Sn atoms (2), rate of diffusion and re-evaporation upon transportation of Sn atom across z-axis from bulk Nb layer (3), electron transfer and electric field upon transportation of Sn atom both across z-axis and xy-plane from bulk Nb layer. Our calculation indicated 30-40% difference from experimental results. Therefore, we conclude that the presence of oxides is important and also Cl impurity can not not be avoided., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, N. Sitaraman, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, R.G. Farber, S.J. Sibener, R.D. Veit, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA, M. Liepe, J.T. Maniscalco, Cornell University (CLASSE), Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education, Ithaca, New York, USA, We develop and apply new tools to understand Nb surface chemistry and fundamental electronic processes using theoretical ab initio methods. We study the thermodynamics of impurities and hydrides in the near-surface region as well as their effect on the surface band gap. This makes it possible for experimentalists to relate changes in STM dI/dV measurements resulting from different preparations to changes in subsurface structure. We also calculate matrix elements for electron-impurity scattering in Nb for common impurities O, N, C, and H. By transforming these matrix elements into a Wannier function basis, we calculate lifetimes for a dense set of states on the Fermi surface and determine the mean free path as a function of impurity density.

Several models and experimental studies have been proposed and performed over the years to understand the origin of these anomalous losses but a general consensus on what these orgins are is yet to be established. In this contribution, we present the results from the RF tests of several 1.3 GHz single-cell cavities limited by the HFQS and tested using a variable input coupler.

In order to achieve a lower surface resistance than Nb at 4.3 K, a superconductor with higher critical temperature should be used, whereas a metal with higher thermal conductivity than Nb should be used to conduct the heat to the cryocoolers.

Here we report extensive numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under the strong rf magnetic field. The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force. We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases, Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities. The original production material came from Two vendors Tokyo Denkai Co., Ltd. (TD) and Ningxia Orient Tantalum Industry Co., Ltd. (OTIC/NX)). It was found TD niobium required a lower annealing temperature (900°C) to obtain satisfactory flux expulsion characteristics compared to NX which required a slightly higher annealing temperature (950°-975°C). In order to ensure the new TD material performed equivalent to the niobium produced 4 year before after 900°C annealing; each heat lot of niobium had its flux expulsion characteristics parametrized and custom thermal treatments developed for each lot.

   Institutions: Radial tuning devices at DESY can be applied to any TESLA shape 1.3 GHz cavity to reduce its elongation due to excessive additional material removal (>300 µm) or to compensate critical manufacturing uncertainties. Radial deformation of cavity cells can be provided by a special chain or a rolling device with three rollers. The chain distributes the radial forces on the equator area around the cell. The rollers are moving radially in relation to the rotating cavity and provide an equator diameter reduction. Both devices have the contour close to the cell shape at the equator area. The required equator radius deviation depends on the tuning target and usually varies between (0.02…0.60) mm.

   Title: Vibro-tumbling as an Alternative to Standard Mechanical Polishing Techniques for SRF Cavities

Indeed, the mechanical polishing is fun-damental also in the superconducting thin film resonant cavities in which one of the main issues that limits the per-formances is the surface preparation. A promising vi-bro-tumbling technique is being studied and implemented with a possibility to replace or improve mechanical treat-ment steps (grinding, barrel polishing). The simplic-ity of the technology allows it to adapt to any cavity geom-etry, both for Nb and Cu materials. The presented work contains last results on 6 GHz cavities obtained at LNL-INFN, both Nb bulk and Cu cavities., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, K.N. Nii, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, Marui Galvanizing Co., Ltd. has been developing vertical electropolishing (VEP) technology for single and nine-cell niobium superconducting radio frequency cavities using a unique cathode namely Ninja cathode in collaboration with KEK. The VEP process usually results in non-uniform removal with a large asymmetry along the cavity length. In order to suppress the asymmetry in removal, we are making different approaches. Flipping of the cavity during the VEP process is one of the approaches applied so far. A unique VEP setup, which allows the flipping of a multi-cell cavity, has been developed as reported earlier. Here, we report the improvement in the setup with automation for cavity flipping. VEP experiments were conducted with the improved system. VEP parameters were studied and the VEP results including the removal trend are discussed in detail., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Y.I. Ida, V. Chouhan, K.N. Niipresenter, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, T. Akabori, G. Mitoya, K. Miyano, HKK, Morioka, Japan, Y. Anetai, F. Takahashi, WING. Co.Ltd, Iwate-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, M. Sawabe, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, The 1st report was delivered in May, 2018 at the IPAC 18 in Vancouver, Canada. The 2nd report was delivered in September, 2018 at the LINAC 18 in Beijing, China. We will make our 3rd report in July, 2019 at the SRF-19 in Dresden, Germany. There will be two main points this time. The first is that by using our improved Ninja Electrode Premium, we can out-perform our number one and number two competitors in terms of uniform electropolishing of the interior of the 9-cell cavity. The second point is that we can remove hydrogen gas, reacted during electropolishing, from the cavity chambers in a manner that has not been successfully achieved by 1st report, May 2018 and 2nd report, September 2018. We will report our 9-cell vertical polishing revolver-type unit that solves the above two problems., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, While the basic process of electropolishing niobium with 1:9 HF:H2SO4 electrolyte has been well characterized, the specific process parameters used to electropolish different superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity geometries requires thoughtful attention. One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization. In preparation for SNS PPU project, JLab performed some EP process development runs with SNS high beta cavities to help identify viable parameter regimes for communication to cavity vendors.

Developing the methods and tools for collecting and characterizing particles found in an accelerator enables process development towards field emission free SRF cavities. Methods are presented for sampling assemblies, components, processes, and environmental conditions utilizing forensic techniques with specialized tooling. Sampling activities to date have produced an inventory of over 850 GSR spindles. Traditional SEM + EDS analysis of this volume of spindles is challenged by labor investment, spindle sampling methods, and the subsequent data pipeline which ultimately results in a statically inadequate dataset for any particulate distribution characterization.

An R&D program has started at DESY, to prepare for a CW upgrade. Cryomodules are being tested in CW mode in our CryoModule Test Bench (CMTB) to study the performance and main issues for such an operation mode. Sensitivity to vibration causing microphonics is one of the main concerns for the CW operation in mode. Therefore a detailed analysis is being performed to evaluate the frequency spectrum of the EXFEL cryomodule main components: the cavity itself, the cavity string, the cold mass and the vacuum vessel.

The JLab prototype cryomodule was instrumented with a series of seven accelerometers, and impulse hammer response measurements were made while the cryomodule was being built and after it was installed in the JLab cryomodule test facility. This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz.

Because of the profound nature of the interaction, we began our study by focusing only on the interaction of Nb with Sn in the absence of Cl and O. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we calculated: (1), binding energy of both vacant and interstitial of the super cell for both Nb and Sn atoms (2), rate of diffusion and re-evaporation upon transportation of Sn atom across z-axis from bulk Nb layer (3), electron transfer and electric field upon transportation of Sn atom both across z-axis and xy-plane from bulk Nb layer. Our calculation indicated 30-40% difference from experimental results.

In order to achieve a lower surface resistance than Nb at 4.3 K, a superconductor with higher critical temperature should be used, whereas a metal with higher thermal conductivity than Nb should be used to conduct the heat to the cryocoolers.

Here we report extensive numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under the strong rf magnetic field. The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force. We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases, Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities.

It was found TD niobium required a lower annealing temperature (900°C) to obtain satisfactory flux expulsion characteristics compared to NX which required a slightly higher annealing temperature (950°-975°C). In order to ensure the new TD material performed equivalent to the niobium produced 4 year before after 900°C annealing; each heat lot of niobium had its flux expulsion characteristics parametrized and custom thermal treatments developed for each lot.

   Title: Vertical Electropolishing of Niobium Nine-Cell Cavity with a Cavity Flipping System for Uniform Removal
   Authors: K.N. Nii, V. Chouhan, Y.I. Ida, T.Y. Yamaguchi, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, Marui Galvanizing Co., Ltd. has been developing vertical electropolishing (VEP) technology for single and nine-cell niobium superconducting radio frequency cavities using a unique cathode namely Ninja cathode in collaboration with KEK. The VEP process usually results in non-uniform removal with a large asymmetry along the cavity length. In order to suppress the asymmetry in removal, we are making different approaches. Flipping of the cavity during the VEP process is one of the approaches applied so far. A unique VEP setup, which allows the flipping of a multi-cell cavity, has been developed as reported earlier. Here, we report the improvement in the setup with automation for cavity flipping. VEP experiments were conducted with the improved system. VEP parameters were studied and the VEP results including the removal trend are discussed in detail., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Y.I. Ida, V. Chouhan, K.N. Niipresenter, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, T. Akabori, G. Mitoya, K. Miyano, HKK, Morioka, Japan, Y. Anetai, F. Takahashi, WING. Co.Ltd, Iwate-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, M. Sawabe, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, The 1st report was delivered in May, 2018 at the IPAC 18 in Vancouver, Canada. The 2nd report was delivered in September, 2018 at the LINAC 18 in Beijing, China. We will make our 3rd report in July, 2019 at the SRF-19 in Dresden, Germany. There will be two main points this time. The first is that by using our improved Ninja Electrode Premium, we can out-perform our number one and number two competitors in terms of uniform electropolishing of the interior of the 9-cell cavity. The second point is that we can remove hydrogen gas, reacted during electropolishing, from the cavity chambers in a manner that has not been successfully achieved by 1st report, May 2018 and 2nd report, September 2018. We will report our 9-cell vertical polishing revolver-type unit that solves the above two problems., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, While the basic process of electropolishing niobium with 1:9 HF:H2SO4 electrolyte has been well characterized, the specific process parameters used to electropolish different superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity geometries requires thoughtful attention. One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization. In preparation for SNS PPU project, JLab performed some EP process development runs with SNS high beta cavities to help identify viable parameter regimes for communication to cavity vendors.

Developing the methods and tools for collecting and characterizing particles found in an accelerator enables process development towards field emission free SRF cavities. Methods are presented for sampling assemblies, components, processes, and environmental conditions utilizing forensic techniques with specialized tooling. Sampling activities to date have produced an inventory of over 850 GSR spindles. Traditional SEM + EDS analysis of this volume of spindles is challenged by labor investment, spindle sampling methods, and the subsequent data pipeline which ultimately results in a statically inadequate dataset for any particulate distribution characterization. A complete systematic analysis of the spindles is enabled by third party software controlling SEM automation for EDS data acquisition.

An R&D program has started at DESY, to prepare for a CW upgrade. Cryomodules are being tested in CW mode in our CryoModule Test Bench (CMTB) to study the performance and main issues for such an operation mode. Sensitivity to vibration causing microphonics is one of the main concerns for the CW operation in mode. Therefore a detailed analysis is being performed to evaluate the frequency spectrum of the EXFEL cryomodule main components: the cavity itself, the cavity string, the cold mass and the vacuum vessel.

The JLab prototype cryomodule was instrumented with a series of seven accelerometers, and impulse hammer response measurements were made while the cryomodule was being built and after it was installed in the JLab cryomodule test facility. This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz.

Here we report extensive numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under the strong rf magnetic field. The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force. We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases, Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities. The original production material came from Two vendors Tokyo Denkai Co., Ltd. (TD) and Ningxia Orient Tantalum Industry Co., Ltd. (OTIC/NX)). It was found TD niobium required a lower annealing temperature (900°C) to obtain satisfactory flux expulsion characteristics compared to NX which required a slightly higher annealing temperature (950°-975°C). In order to ensure the new TD material performed equivalent to the niobium produced 4 year before after 900°C annealing; each heat lot of niobium had its flux expulsion characteristics parametrized and custom thermal treatments developed for each lot.

   Title: Development of Vertical Electropolishing Facility for Nb 9-Cell Cavity (3)
   Authors: Y.I. Ida, V. Chouhan, K.N. Niipresenter, MGH, Hyogo-ken, Japan, T. Akabori, G. Mitoya, K. Miyano, HKK, Morioka, Japan, Y. Anetai, F. Takahashi, WING. Co.Ltd, Iwate-ken, Japan, H. Hayano, S. Kato, H. Monjushiro, T. Saeki, M. Sawabe, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, The 1st report was delivered in May, 2018 at the IPAC 18 in Vancouver, Canada. The 2nd report was delivered in September, 2018 at the LINAC 18 in Beijing, China. We will make our 3rd report in July, 2019 at the SRF-19 in Dresden, Germany. There will be two main points this time. The first is that by using our improved Ninja Electrode Premium, we can out-perform our number one and number two competitors in terms of uniform electropolishing of the interior of the 9-cell cavity. The second point is that we can remove hydrogen gas, reacted during electropolishing, from the cavity chambers in a manner that has not been successfully achieved by 1st report, May 2018 and 2nd report, September 2018. We will report our 9-cell vertical polishing revolver-type unit that solves the above two problems., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, While the basic process of electropolishing niobium with 1:9 HF:H2SO4 electrolyte has been well characterized, the specific process parameters used to electropolish different superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity geometries requires thoughtful attention. One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization. In preparation for SNS PPU project, JLab performed some EP process development runs with SNS high beta cavities to help identify viable parameter regimes for communication to cavity vendors. Results from this study are presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, J.K. Spradlin, C.E. Reecepresenter, O. Trofimova, A-M. Valente-Feliciano, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, Foreign particles residing on the field carrying surface of accelerator cavities are a known mechanism for field emission. Developing the methods and tools for collecting and characterizing particles found in an accelerator enables process development towards field emission free SRF cavities. Methods are presented for sampling assemblies, components, processes, and environmental conditions utilizing forensic techniques with specialized tooling. Sampling activities to date have produced an inventory of over 850 GSR spindles. Traditional SEM + EDS analysis of this volume of spindles is challenged by labor investment, spindle sampling methods, and the subsequent data pipeline which ultimately results in a statically inadequate dataset for any particulate distribution characterization. A complete systematic analysis of the spindles is enabled by third party software controlling SEM automation for EDS data acquisition. Details of spindle creation, collection equipment, component sampling, automating particle assessment, and data analysis used to characterize samples from beamline elements in CEBAF are presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Y. Jung, B.H. Choi, D.H. Gil, M.O. Hyunpresenter, H. Kim, J.W. Kim, M.S. Kim, D.Y. Lee, J. Lee, S. Lee, IBS, Daejeon, Republic of Korea, Vertical tests of a prototype half-wave resonator cavity are being tested.

An R&D program has started at DESY, to prepare for a CW upgrade. Cryomodules are being tested in CW mode in our CryoModule Test Bench (CMTB) to study the performance and main issues for such an operation mode. Sensitivity to vibration causing microphonics is one of the main concerns for the CW operation in mode. Therefore a detailed analysis is being performed to evaluate the frequency spectrum of the EXFEL cryomodule main components: the cavity itself, the cavity string, the cold mass and the vacuum vessel. Finite Element Modal Analyses have been performed and the results compared with data measured at the CMTB.

The cavities have design loaded-Q of 4×107, which means that it has a control bandwidth of 16 Hz. The JLab prototype cryomodule was instrumented with a series of seven accelerometers, and impulse hammer response measurements were made while the cryomodule was being built and after it was installed in the JLab cryomodule test facility. This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz.

These modules are based on the ELBE modules of the Helmholtz Center Dresden-Rossendorf but are modified to suit the high current and energy-recovering operation at MESA. The energy gain per module per turn should be 25 MeV, provided by two TESLA cavities, which were vertically tested at DESY, Hamburg, Germany. These tests showed an excellent performance of the quench limit and quality factor for three out of the four cavities. The fourth cavity has a lower but still acceptable quench limit and quality factor. In order to validate the performance of the fully assembled cryomodules after delivery to Mainz a test stand has been set up at the Helmholtz Institut Mainz.

The measurements were performed for fully assembled cavities as well as for bare niobium cavities without the titanium jacket. In the procedure, the instantaneous resonant frequencies were measured for 10 seconds at a time interval of 1 ms and were recorded as a time series. The frequencies were analyzed by means of conventional signal analysis. The power spectrum was deduced from the autocorrelation function calculated with the fluctuation of resonant frequencies. Although the vibration amplitudes were smaller in the cavities assembled with the titanium jacket, we could not find a clear reason for this., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Ab-initio Study of Atomic Scale Interaction Among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O, A.B. Tesfamichael, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, We employed a combination of ab-initio calculations and statistical mechanical models to understand the nature of atomic scale interaction among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O. Because of the profound nature of the interaction, we began our study by focusing only on the interaction of Nb with Sn in the absence of Cl and O. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we calculated: (1), binding energy of both vacant and interstitial of the super cell for both Nb and Sn atoms (2), rate of diffusion and re-evaporation upon transportation of Sn atom across z-axis from bulk Nb layer (3), electron transfer and electric field upon transportation of Sn atom both across z-axis and xy-plane from bulk Nb layer. Our calculation indicated 30-40% difference from experimental results. Therefore, we conclude that the presence of oxides is important and also Cl impurity can not not be avoided., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, N. Sitaraman, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, R.G. Farber, S.J. Sibener, R.D. Veit, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA, M. Liepe, J.T. Maniscalco, Cornell University (CLASSE), Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education, Ithaca, New York, USA, We develop and apply new tools to understand Nb surface chemistry and fundamental electronic processes using theoretical ab initio methods. We study the thermodynamics of impurities and hydrides in the near-surface region as well as their effect on the surface band gap. This makes it possible for experimentalists to relate changes in STM dI/dV measurements resulting from different preparations to changes in subsurface structure. We also calculate matrix elements for electron-impurity scattering in Nb for common impurities O, N, C, and H. By transforming these matrix elements into a Wannier function basis, we calculate lifetimes for a dense set of states on the Fermi surface and determine the mean free path as a function of impurity density.

Here we report extensive numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under the strong rf magnetic field. The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force. We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases, Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities.

   Title: An Experimental Analysis of Effective EP Parameters for Low-Frequency Cylindrical Nb Cavities
   Authors: JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, While the basic process of electropolishing niobium with 1:9 HF:H2SO4 electrolyte has been well characterized, the specific process parameters used to electropolish different superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity geometries requires thoughtful attention. One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent, this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity, but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations "off the current plateau, " yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization. In preparation for SNS PPU project, JLab performed some EP process development runs with SNS high beta cavities to help identify viable parameter regimes for communication to cavity vendors. Results from this study are presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, J.K. Spradlin, C.E. Reecepresenter, O. Trofimova, A-M. Valente-Feliciano, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, Foreign particles residing on the field carrying surface of accelerator cavities are a known mechanism for field emission. Developing the methods and tools for collecting and characterizing particles found in an accelerator enables process development towards field emission free SRF cavities. Methods are presented for sampling assemblies, components, processes, and environmental conditions utilizing forensic techniques with specialized tooling. Sampling activities to date have produced an inventory of over 850 GSR spindles. Traditional SEM + EDS analysis of this volume of spindles is challenged by labor investment, spindle sampling methods, and the subsequent data pipeline which ultimately results in a statically inadequate dataset for any particulate distribution characterization. A complete systematic analysis of the spindles is enabled by third party software controlling SEM automation for EDS data acquisition. Details of spindle creation, collection equipment, component sampling, automating particle assessment, and data analysis used to characterize samples from beamline elements in CEBAF are presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Y. Jung, B.H. Choi, D.H. Gil, M.O. Hyunpresenter, H. Kim, J.W. Kim, M.S. Kim, D.Y. Lee, J. Lee, S. Lee, IBS, Daejeon, Republic of Korea, Vertical tests of a prototype half-wave resonator cavity are being tested.

An R&D program has started at DESY, to prepare for a CW upgrade. Cryomodules are being tested in CW mode in our CryoModule Test Bench (CMTB) to study the performance and main issues for such an operation mode. Sensitivity to vibration causing microphonics is one of the main concerns for the CW operation in mode. Therefore a detailed analysis is being performed to evaluate the frequency spectrum of the EXFEL cryomodule main components: the cavity itself, the cavity string, the cold mass and the vacuum vessel. Finite Element Modal Analyses have been performed and the results compared with data measured at the CMTB.

The cavities have design loaded-Q of 4×107, which means that it has a control bandwidth of 16 Hz. The JLab prototype cryomodule was instrumented with a series of seven accelerometers, and impulse hammer response measurements were made while the cryomodule was being built and after it was installed in the JLab cryomodule test facility. This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz. Results of the modal analysis as well as the background microphonics observed when operated under various cryogenic conditions and with different modifications will be presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, B. Schriefer, W. Anders, A. Heugel, H. Hoffmann, G. Mielczarek, H. Stein, HZB, Berlin, Germany, In Berlin-Adlershof the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) is constructing the energy recovery linac ¿BERLinPro¿.

These modules are based on the ELBE modules of the Helmholtz Center Dresden-Rossendorf but are modified to suit the high current and energy-recovering operation at MESA. The energy gain per module per turn should be 25 MeV, provided by two TESLA cavities, which were vertically tested at DESY, Hamburg, Germany. These tests showed an excellent performance of the quench limit and quality factor for three out of the four cavities.

The measurements were performed for fully assembled cavities as well as for bare niobium cavities without the titanium jacket. In the procedure, the instantaneous resonant frequencies were measured for 10 seconds at a time interval of 1 ms and were recorded as a time series. The frequencies were analyzed by means of conventional signal analysis. The power spectrum was deduced from the autocorrelation function calculated with the fluctuation of resonant frequencies.

Because of the profound nature of the interaction, we began our study by focusing only on the interaction of Nb with Sn in the absence of Cl and O. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we calculated: (1), binding energy of both vacant and interstitial of the super cell for both Nb and Sn atoms (2), rate of diffusion and re-evaporation upon transportation of Sn atom across z-axis from bulk Nb layer (3), electron transfer and electric field upon transportation of Sn atom both across z-axis and xy-plane from bulk Nb layer. Our calculation indicated 30-40% difference from experimental results.

We study the thermodynamics of impurities and hydrides in the near-surface region as well as their effect on the surface band gap. This makes it possible for experimentalists to relate changes in STM dI/dV measurements resulting from different preparations to changes in subsurface structure. We also calculate matrix elements for electron-impurity scattering in Nb for common impurities O, N, C, and H. By transforming these matrix elements into a Wannier function basis, we calculate lifetimes for a dense set of states on the Fermi surface and determine the mean free path as a function of impurity density.

Several models and experimental studies have been proposed and performed over the years to understand the origin of these anomalous losses but a general consensus on what these orgins are is yet to be established. In this contribution, we present the results from the RF tests of several 1.3 GHz single-cell cavities limited by the HFQS and tested using a variable input coupler. This allowed to maintain close to critical coupling even at high field and the data showed that the HFQS did not saturate and that in some cases a power dissipation of up to 200 W at 2 K could be sustained without quench., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, G. Ciovati, G. Cheng, E. Daly, G.V. Eremeev, J. Henry, R.A. Rimmer, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, ODU, Norfolk, Virginia, USA, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia, USA, Industrial application of SRF technology would favor the use of cryocoolers to conductively cool SRF cavities for particle accelerators, operating at or above 4.3 K. In order to achieve a lower surface resistance than Nb at 4.3 K, a superconductor with higher critical temperature should be used, whereas a metal with higher thermal conductivity than Nb should be used to conduct the heat to the cryocoolers. A standard 1.5 GHz bulk Nb single-cell cavity has been coated with a ~2 µm thick layer of Nb3Sn on the inner surface and with a 5 mm thick Cu layer on the outer surface for conduction cooled applications. The cavity performance has been measured at 4.3 K and 2.0 K in liquid He.

   Title: Automation of Particulate Characterization
   Authors: J.K. Spradlin, C.E. Reecepresenter, O. Trofimova, A-M. Valente-Feliciano, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, Foreign particles residing on the field carrying surface of accelerator cavities are a known mechanism for field emission. Developing the methods and tools for collecting and characterizing particles found in an accelerator enables process development towards field emission free SRF cavities. Methods are presented for sampling assemblies, components, processes, and environmental conditions utilizing forensic techniques with specialized tooling. Sampling activities to date have produced an inventory of over 850 GSR spindles. Traditional SEM + EDS analysis of this volume of spindles is challenged by labor investment, spindle sampling methods, and the subsequent data pipeline which ultimately results in a statically inadequate dataset for any particulate distribution characterization. A complete systematic analysis of the spindles is enabled by third party software controlling SEM automation for EDS data acquisition. Details of spindle creation, collection equipment, component sampling, automating particle assessment, and data analysis used to characterize samples from beamline elements in CEBAF are presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Y. Jung, B.H. Choi, D.H. Gil, M.O. Hyunpresenter, H. Kim, J.W. Kim, M.S. Kim, D.Y. Lee, J. Lee, S. Lee, IBS, Daejeon, Republic of Korea, Vertical tests of a prototype half-wave resonator cavity are being tested. The performance of the cavities, such as quality factor and accelerating electrical field, are measured and compared to the target design value. In previous study, we reported the effect of the heat treatment on a prototype bare HWR cavity. We baked a jacketed HWR cavity to improve a performance for 10 h at 650°C. In this study, we will report the effect of the heat treatment on the jacketed HWR cavity., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, M.O. Hyun, H.C. Jung, Y. Kim, M. Lee, IBS, Daejeon, Republic of Korea, The Rare Isotope Science Project (RISP) in the Institute of Basic Science (IBS), Korea, is developing and con-structing the multi-purpose linear accelerator at the north side of Daejeon, South Korea. RISP accelerator (RAON) is composed with low-energy region (SCL3) and high-energy region (SCL2), and low-energy region is made with quarter-wave resonator (QWR) and half-wave resonator (HWR) when high-energy region is made with single spoke resonator type-1 (SSR1) and type-2 (SSR2). This paper shows about the initial resonance issues of QWR superconducting (SC) cavity during cold test and SRF disturbance measurement. Afterwards, this paper shows the modal analysis and vibration test of QWR SC cavity., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, S. Barbanotti, A. Bellandi, J. Branlard, K. Jensch, DESY, Hamburg, Germany, Future upgrades of the European X-ray Free Electron Laser (EXFEL) may require driving the linac at higher duty factor, possibly extending to Continuous Wave (CW) mode. An R&D program has started at DESY, to prepare for a CW upgrade. Cryomodules are being tested in CW mode in our CryoModule Test Bench (CMTB) to study the performance and main issues for such an operation mode. Sensitivity to vibration causing microphonics is one of the main concerns for the CW operation in mode. Therefore a detailed analysis is being performed to evaluate the frequency spectrum of the EXFEL cryomodule main components: the cavity itself, the cavity string, the cold mass and the vacuum vessel. Finite Element Modal Analyses have been performed and the results compared with data measured at the CMTB. This paper summarizes the main results and conclusions of such a study., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, T. Powers, N.C. Brock, G.K. Davis, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, Jefferson Lab is partnering with Fermilab to build the 36 cryomodules for the LCLS II accelerator that will be installed at SLAC. The cavities have design loaded-Q of 4×107, which means that it has a control bandwidth of 16 Hz. The JLab prototype cryomodule was instrumented with a series of seven accelerometers, and impulse hammer response measurements were made while the cryomodule was being built and after it was installed in the JLab cryomodule test facility. This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz. Results of the modal analysis as well as the background microphonics observed when operated under various cryogenic conditions and with different modifications will be presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, B. Schriefer, W. Anders, A. Heugel, H. Hoffmann, G. Mielczarek, H. Stein, HZB, Berlin, Germany, In Berlin-Adlershof the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) is constructing the energy recovery linac ¿BERLinPro¿. Three klystron transmitters each 270 kWCW at 1.3 GHz are installed at the injection path of the ERL. The RF plant includes circulators and water loads.

In this project, a new superconducting (SC) booster linac, so-called SRILAC, is being developed and constructed. The SRILAC consists of 10 TEM quarter-wavelength resonators made of pure niobium sheets which operate at 4 K. The target performance of each cavity is set as Q0 of 1×109 with its accelerating gradient of 6.8 MV/m. Recently we succeeded to develop high performance SC-cavities which satisfies the requirement with a wide margin. The cryomodule assembly is under way, and installation of cryomodules and He liquefaction system will be completed by the end of FY2018. The cooling-down test is scheduled in the Q1 of FY2019. This contribution makes a report on the construction status of the SRILAC., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, T. Stengler, K. Aulenbacher, F. Hug, S.D.W. Thomas, KPH, Mainz, Germany, GSI, Darmstadt, Germany, HIM, Mainz, Germany, The two superconducting radio frequency acceleration cryomodules for the new multiturn ERL ’Mainz Energy Recovering Superconducting Accelerator’ MESA at Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz have been fabricated and are currently under testing at the Helmholtz Institut Mainz. These modules are based on the ELBE modules of the Helmholtz Center Dresden-Rossendorf but are modified to suit the high current and energy-recovering operation at MESA. The energy gain per module per turn should be 25 MeV, provided by two TESLA cavities, which were vertically tested at DESY, Hamburg, Germany. These tests showed an excellent performance of the quench limit and quality factor for three out of the four cavities. The fourth cavity has a lower but still acceptable quench limit and quality factor. In order to validate the performance of the fully assembled cryomodules after delivery to Mainz a test stand has been set up at the Helmholtz Institut Mainz. The test stand is described in detail and the status of the module testing is reported., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, O. Kamigaito, K. Ozeki, N. Sakamoto, K. Suda, K. Yamada, RIKEN Nishina Center, Wako, Japan, Mechanical vibration of quarter-wavelength resonators of SRILAC, the superconducting booster of the RIKEN heavy-ion linac, was measured during a vertical cold test. The measurements were performed for fully assembled cavities as well as for bare niobium cavities without the titanium jacket. In the procedure, the instantaneous resonant frequencies were measured for 10 seconds at a time interval of 1 ms and were recorded as a time series. The frequencies were analyzed by means of conventional signal analysis. The power spectrum was deduced from the autocorrelation function calculated with the fluctuation of resonant frequencies. Although the vibration amplitudes were smaller in the cavities assembled with the titanium jacket, we could not find a clear reason for this., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Ab-initio Study of Atomic Scale Interaction Among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O, A.B. Tesfamichael, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, We employed a combination of ab-initio calculations and statistical mechanical models to understand the nature of atomic scale interaction among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O. Because of the profound nature of the interaction, we began our study by focusing only on the interaction of Nb with Sn in the absence of Cl and O. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we calculated: (1), binding energy of both vacant and interstitial of the super cell for both Nb and Sn atoms (2), rate of diffusion and re-evaporation upon transportation of Sn atom across z-axis from bulk Nb layer (3), electron transfer and electric field upon transportation of Sn atom both across z-axis and xy-plane from bulk Nb layer. Our calculation indicated 30-40% difference from experimental results. Therefore, we conclude that the presence of oxides is important and also Cl impurity can not not be avoided., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, N. Sitaraman, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, R.G. Farber, S.J. Sibener, R.D. Veit, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA, M. Liepe, J.T. Maniscalco, Cornell University (CLASSE), Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education, Ithaca, New York, USA, We develop and apply new tools to understand Nb surface chemistry and fundamental electronic processes using theoretical ab initio methods. We study the thermodynamics of impurities and hydrides in the near-surface region as well as their effect on the surface band gap. This makes it possible for experimentalists to relate changes in STM dI/dV measurements resulting from different preparations to changes in subsurface structure. We also calculate matrix elements for electron-impurity scattering in Nb for common impurities O, N, C, and H. By transforming these matrix elements into a Wannier function basis, we calculate lifetimes for a dense set of states on the Fermi surface and determine the mean free path as a function of impurity density. This technique can be generalized to calculate other scattering amplitudes and timescales relevant to SRF theory., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Low Frequency, Low Beta Cavity Performance Improvement Studies, P. Kolb, R.E. Laxdal, Z.Y. Yao, TRIUMF, Vancouver, Canada, In recent years, new discoveries such as N2 doping and infusion lead to a significant increases in Q0 and accelerating gradient for 1.3 GHz, β=1 elliptical cavities. To understand and to adapt these treatments for lower frequency, \beta < 1 cavities, two coaxial test cavities, one quarter-wave resonator (QWR) and one half-wave resonator (HWR), have been built and put through a systematic study of these new treatments to show the effectiveness of these treatments at different frequencies. These cavities are tested in their fundamental mode and several higher order modes to study the frequency dependence of new cavity treatments such as N2 doping and infusion. Results of these studies are presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, A.V. Gurevich, I.P. Parajuli, ODU, Norfolk, Virginia, USA, The performance of high-purity, bulk niobium SRF cavities treated by chemical processes such as BCP or EP is limited by the so-called high-field Q-slope (HFQS). Several models and experimental studies have been proposed and performed over the years to understand the origin of these anomalous losses but a general consensus on what these orgins are is yet to be established. In this contribution, we present the results from the RF tests of several 1.3 GHz single-cell cavities limited by the HFQS and tested using a variable input coupler. This allowed to maintain close to critical coupling even at high field and the data showed that the HFQS did not saturate and that in some cases a power dissipation of up to 200 W at 2 K could be sustained without quench., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, G. Ciovati, G. Cheng, E. Daly, G.V. Eremeev, J. Henry, R.A. Rimmer, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, ODU, Norfolk, Virginia, USA, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia, USA, Industrial application of SRF technology would favor the use of cryocoolers to conductively cool SRF cavities for particle accelerators, operating at or above 4.3 K. In order to achieve a lower surface resistance than Nb at 4.3 K, a superconductor with higher critical temperature should be used, whereas a metal with higher thermal conductivity than Nb should be used to conduct the heat to the cryocoolers. A standard 1.5 GHz bulk Nb single-cell cavity has been coated with a ~2 µm thick layer of Nb3Sn on the inner surface and with a 5 mm thick Cu layer on the outer surface for conduction cooled applications. The cavity performance has been measured at 4.3 K and 2.0 K in liquid He. The cavity reached a peak surface magnetic field of ~40 mT with a quality factor of 6×109 and 3.5×109 at 4.3 K, before and after applying the thick Cu layer, respectively., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, J.T. Maniscalco, T. Gruber, A.T. Holic, M. Liepe, Cornell University (CLASSE), Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education, Ithaca, New York, USA, The Cornell DC Field Dependence Cavity is a new coaxial test resonator designed to study the impact of strong (up to 200 mT or more) DC surface magnetic fields on the superconducting surface resistance, providing physical insight into the root of the ‘‘anti-Q-slope’’ and probing critical fields.

Mechanisms of flux pinning depend on the materials treatment and cool-down conditions. A magnetic field scanning system using flux-gate magnetometers and Hall probes has been designed and built to allow measuring the local magnetic field of trapped vortices normal to the outer surface of 1.3 GHz single-cell SRF cavities at cryogenic temperatures.

Here we report extensive numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under the strong rf magnetic field. The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force. We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases, Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields. These results suggest that trapped vortices can contribute to the extended Q(H) rise observed on the SRF cavities., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, P. Garg, K.N. Solanki, Arizona State University, Tempe, USA, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA, NHMFL, Tallahassee, Florida, USA, Niobium is basis for all superconducting radio frequency cavities, a technology that accelerates charged particle beams to energy levels not possible by other means. When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities. The original production material came from Two vendors Tokyo Denkai Co., Ltd. (TD) and Ningxia Orient Tantalum Industry Co., Ltd. (OTIC/NX)). It was found TD niobium required a lower annealing temperature (900°C) to obtain satisfactory flux expulsion characteristics compared to NX which required a slightly higher annealing temperature (950°-975°C). In order to ensure the new TD material performed equivalent to the niobium produced 4 year before after 900°C annealing; each heat lot of niobium had its flux expulsion characteristics parametrized and custom thermal treatments developed for each lot. Subsequent pure heat lot 9 cell cavities were made and tested.

The performance of the cavities, such as quality factor and accelerating electrical field, are measured and compared to the target design value. In previous study, we reported the effect of the heat treatment on a prototype bare HWR cavity. We baked a jacketed HWR cavity to improve a performance for 10 h at 650°C. In this study, we will report the effect of the heat treatment on the jacketed HWR cavity., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, M.O. Hyun, H.C. Jung, Y. Kim, M. Lee, IBS, Daejeon, Republic of Korea, The Rare Isotope Science Project (RISP) in the Institute of Basic Science (IBS), Korea, is developing and con-structing the multi-purpose linear accelerator at the north side of Daejeon, South Korea.

These modules are based on the ELBE modules of the Helmholtz Center Dresden-Rossendorf but are modified to suit the high current and energy-recovering operation at MESA. The energy gain per module per turn should be 25 MeV, provided by two TESLA cavities, which were vertically tested at DESY, Hamburg, Germany. These tests showed an excellent performance of the quench limit and quality factor for three out of the four cavities. The fourth cavity has a lower but still acceptable quench limit and quality factor. In order to validate the performance of the fully assembled cryomodules after delivery to Mainz a test stand has been set up at the Helmholtz Institut Mainz. The test stand is described in detail and the status of the module testing is reported., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, O. Kamigaito, K. Ozeki, N. Sakamoto, K. Suda, K. Yamada, RIKEN Nishina Center, Wako, Japan, Mechanical vibration of quarter-wavelength resonators of SRILAC, the superconducting booster of the RIKEN heavy-ion linac, was measured during a vertical cold test. The measurements were performed for fully assembled cavities as well as for bare niobium cavities without the titanium jacket. In the procedure, the instantaneous resonant frequencies were measured for 10 seconds at a time interval of 1 ms and were recorded as a time series. The frequencies were analyzed by means of conventional signal analysis. The power spectrum was deduced from the autocorrelation function calculated with the fluctuation of resonant frequencies. Although the vibration amplitudes were smaller in the cavities assembled with the titanium jacket, we could not find a clear reason for this., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Ab-initio Study of Atomic Scale Interaction Among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O, A.B. Tesfamichael, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, We employed a combination of ab-initio calculations and statistical mechanical models to understand the nature of atomic scale interaction among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O. Because of the profound nature of the interaction, we began our study by focusing only on the interaction of Nb with Sn in the absence of Cl and O. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we calculated: (1), binding energy of both vacant and interstitial of the super cell for both Nb and Sn atoms (2), rate of diffusion and re-evaporation upon transportation of Sn atom across z-axis from bulk Nb layer (3), electron transfer and electric field upon transportation of Sn atom both across z-axis and xy-plane from bulk Nb layer. Our calculation indicated 30-40% difference from experimental results. Therefore, we conclude that the presence of oxides is important and also Cl impurity can not not be avoided., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, N. Sitaraman, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, R.G. Farber, S.J. Sibener, R.D. Veit, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA, M. Liepe, J.T. Maniscalco, Cornell University (CLASSE), Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education, Ithaca, New York, USA, We develop and apply new tools to understand Nb surface chemistry and fundamental electronic processes using theoretical ab initio methods. We study the thermodynamics of impurities and hydrides in the near-surface region as well as their effect on the surface band gap. This makes it possible for experimentalists to relate changes in STM dI/dV measurements resulting from different preparations to changes in subsurface structure. We also calculate matrix elements for electron-impurity scattering in Nb for common impurities O, N, C, and H. By transforming these matrix elements into a Wannier function basis, we calculate lifetimes for a dense set of states on the Fermi surface and determine the mean free path as a function of impurity density. This technique can be generalized to calculate other scattering amplitudes and timescales relevant to SRF theory., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Low Frequency, Low Beta Cavity Performance Improvement Studies, P. Kolb, R.E. Laxdal, Z.Y. Yao, TRIUMF, Vancouver, Canada, In recent years, new discoveries such as N2 doping and infusion lead to a significant increases in Q0 and accelerating gradient for 1.3 GHz, β=1 elliptical cavities. To understand and to adapt these treatments for lower frequency, \beta < 1 cavities, two coaxial test cavities, one quarter-wave resonator (QWR) and one half-wave resonator (HWR), have been built and put through a systematic study of these new treatments to show the effectiveness of these treatments at different frequencies. These cavities are tested in their fundamental mode and several higher order modes to study the frequency dependence of new cavity treatments such as N2 doping and infusion.

Several models and experimental studies have been proposed and performed over the years to understand the origin of these anomalous losses but a general consensus on what these orgins are is yet to be established. In this contribution, we present the results from the RF tests of several 1.3 GHz single-cell cavities limited by the HFQS and tested using a variable input coupler. This allowed to maintain close to critical coupling even at high field and the data showed that the HFQS did not saturate and that in some cases a power dissipation of up to 200 W at 2 K could be sustained without quench., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, G. Ciovati, G. Cheng, E. Daly, G.V. Eremeev, J. Henry, R.A. Rimmer, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, ODU, Norfolk, Virginia, USA, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia, USA, Industrial application of SRF technology would favor the use of cryocoolers to conductively cool SRF cavities for particle accelerators, operating at or above 4.3 K. In order to achieve a lower surface resistance than Nb at 4.3 K, a superconductor with higher critical temperature should be used, whereas a metal with higher thermal conductivity than Nb should be used to conduct the heat to the cryocoolers. A standard 1.5 GHz bulk Nb single-cell cavity has been coated with a ~2 µm thick layer of Nb3Sn on the inner surface and with a 5 mm thick Cu layer on the outer surface for conduction cooled applications. The cavity performance has been measured at 4.3 K and 2.0 K in liquid He. The cavity reached a peak surface magnetic field of ~40 mT with a quality factor of 6×109 and 3.5×109 at 4.3 K, before and after applying the thick Cu layer, respectively., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, J.T. Maniscalco, T. Gruber, A.T. Holic, M. Liepe, Cornell University (CLASSE), Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education, Ithaca, New York, USA, The Cornell DC Field Dependence Cavity is a new coaxial test resonator designed to study the impact of strong (up to 200 mT or more) DC surface magnetic fields on the superconducting surface resistance, providing physical insight into the root of the ‘‘anti-Q-slope’’ and probing critical fields.

Mechanisms of flux pinning depend on the materials treatment and cool-down conditions. A magnetic field scanning system using flux-gate magnetometers and Hall probes has been designed and built to allow measuring the local magnetic field of trapped vortices normal to the outer surface of 1.3 GHz single-cell SRF cavities at cryogenic temperatures.

Here we report extensive numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under the strong rf magnetic field. The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force. We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases, Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields. These results suggest that trapped vortices can contribute to the extended Q(H) rise observed on the SRF cavities., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, P. Garg, K.N. Solanki, Arizona State University, Tempe, USA, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA, NHMFL, Tallahassee, Florida, USA, Niobium is basis for all superconducting radio frequency cavities, a technology that accelerates charged particle beams to energy levels not possible by other means. When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities. The original production material came from Two vendors Tokyo Denkai Co., Ltd. (TD) and Ningxia Orient Tantalum Industry Co., Ltd. (OTIC/NX)). It was found TD niobium required a lower annealing temperature (900°C) to obtain satisfactory flux expulsion characteristics compared to NX which required a slightly higher annealing temperature (950°-975°C). In order to ensure the new TD material performed equivalent to the niobium produced 4 year before after 900°C annealing; each heat lot of niobium had its flux expulsion characteristics parametrized and custom thermal treatments developed for each lot. Subsequent pure heat lot 9 cell cavities were made and tested. We will look at the flux expulsion characteristics of each lot, and RF loss of the 9-cell cavities produced using the individual heat lots., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS/IN2P3, IJCLab, Orsay, France, Trapped residual magnetic flux is responsible of residual resistance degradation on superconducting materials used in SRF technologies.

Atomic Force Microscopy studies on cavity cut-outs gives a possible mechanism responsible for this branching in performance, namely, the dissociation and growth of room temperature niobium nano-hydrides that exist near the RF surface, which are made superconduct-ing only through the proximity effect.

The RF and mechanical design of the SSR2 cavities has been completed and satisfies the technical requirements. However, our resent results of the high RF power tests of fully dressed SSR1 cavities show considerably strong multipacting (MP), which took significant time to process. On the other hand, the new results of the tests of balloon cavity showed significant mitigation of MP. In this paper we present the results of the improved design of the SSR2 cavity, based on the balloon cavity concept. The electromagnetic design is presented, including RF parameter optimization, MP simulations, field asymmetry analysis, High Order Mode (HOM) calculations. Mechanical analysis of the dressed cavity is presented also, which includes Lorentz Force Detuning optimization, and reduction of the cavity resonance frequency sensitivity versus He pressure fluctuations.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities.

It was found TD niobium required a lower annealing temperature (900°C) to obtain satisfactory flux expulsion characteristics compared to NX which required a slightly higher annealing temperature (950°-975°C).

   Title: Modal Analysis of the EXFEL 1.3 GHz Cavity and Cryomodule Main Components and Comparison with Measured Data
   Authors: S. Barbanotti, A. Bellandi, J. Branlard, K. Jensch, DESY, Hamburg, Germany, Future upgrades of the European X-ray Free Electron Laser (EXFEL) may require driving the linac at higher duty factor, possibly extending to Continuous Wave (CW) mode. An R&D program has started at DESY, to prepare for a CW upgrade. Cryomodules are being tested in CW mode in our CryoModule Test Bench (CMTB) to study the performance and main issues for such an operation mode. Sensitivity to vibration causing microphonics is one of the main concerns for the CW operation in mode. Therefore a detailed analysis is being performed to evaluate the frequency spectrum of the EXFEL cryomodule main components: the cavity itself, the cavity string, the cold mass and the vacuum vessel. Finite Element Modal Analyses have been performed and the results compared with data measured at the CMTB. This paper summarizes the main results and conclusions of such a study., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, T. Powers, N.C. Brock, G.K. Davis, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, Jefferson Lab is partnering with Fermilab to build the 36 cryomodules for the LCLS II accelerator that will be installed at SLAC. The cavities have design loaded-Q of 4×107, which means that it has a control bandwidth of 16 Hz. The JLab prototype cryomodule was instrumented with a series of seven accelerometers, and impulse hammer response measurements were made while the cryomodule was being built and after it was installed in the JLab cryomodule test facility. This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz. Results of the modal analysis as well as the background microphonics observed when operated under various cryogenic conditions and with different modifications will be presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, B. Schriefer, W. Anders, A. Heugel, H. Hoffmann, G. Mielczarek, H. Stein, HZB, Berlin, Germany, In Berlin-Adlershof the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) is constructing the energy recovery linac ¿BERLinPro¿.

   Title: Microphonics Testing of LCLS II Cryomodules at Jefferson Lab
   Authors: T. Powers, N.C. Brock, G.K. Davis, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, Jefferson Lab is partnering with Fermilab to build the 36 cryomodules for the LCLS II accelerator that will be installed at SLAC. The cavities have design loaded-Q of 4×107, which means that it has a control bandwidth of 16 Hz. The JLab prototype cryomodule was instrumented with a series of seven accelerometers, and impulse hammer response measurements were made while the cryomodule was being built and after it was installed in the JLab cryomodule test facility. This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz. Results of the modal analysis as well as the background microphonics observed when operated under various cryogenic conditions and with different modifications will be presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, B. Schriefer, W. Anders, A. Heugel, H. Hoffmann, G. Mielczarek, H. Stein, HZB, Berlin, Germany, In Berlin-Adlershof the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) is constructing the energy recovery linac ¿BERLinPro¿.

In this project, a new superconducting (SC) booster linac, so-called SRILAC, is being developed and constructed. The SRILAC consists of 10 TEM quarter-wavelength resonators made of pure niobium sheets which operate at 4 K. The target performance of each cavity is set as Q0 of 1×109 with its accelerating gradient of 6.8 MV/m. Recently we succeeded to develop high performance SC-cavities which satisfies the requirement with a wide margin. The cryomodule assembly is under way, and installation of cryomodules and He liquefaction system will be completed by the end of FY2018. The cooling-down test is scheduled in the Q1 of FY2019. This contribution makes a report on the construction status of the SRILAC., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, T. Stengler, K. Aulenbacher, F. Hug, S.D.W. Thomas, KPH, Mainz, Germany, GSI, Darmstadt, Germany, HIM, Mainz, Germany, The two superconducting radio frequency acceleration cryomodules for the new multiturn ERL ’Mainz Energy Recovering Superconducting Accelerator’ MESA at Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz have been fabricated and are currently under testing at the Helmholtz Institut Mainz. These modules are based on the ELBE modules of the Helmholtz Center Dresden-Rossendorf but are modified to suit the high current and energy-recovering operation at MESA. The energy gain per module per turn should be 25 MeV, provided by two TESLA cavities, which were vertically tested at DESY, Hamburg, Germany. These tests showed an excellent performance of the quench limit and quality factor for three out of the four cavities. The fourth cavity has a lower but still acceptable quench limit and quality factor. In order to validate the performance of the fully assembled cryomodules after delivery to Mainz a test stand has been set up at the Helmholtz Institut Mainz. The test stand is described in detail and the status of the module testing is reported., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, O. Kamigaito, K. Ozeki, N. Sakamoto, K. Suda, K. Yamada, RIKEN Nishina Center, Wako, Japan, Mechanical vibration of quarter-wavelength resonators of SRILAC, the superconducting booster of the RIKEN heavy-ion linac, was measured during a vertical cold test. The measurements were performed for fully assembled cavities as well as for bare niobium cavities without the titanium jacket. In the procedure, the instantaneous resonant frequencies were measured for 10 seconds at a time interval of 1 ms and were recorded as a time series. The frequencies were analyzed by means of conventional signal analysis. The power spectrum was deduced from the autocorrelation function calculated with the fluctuation of resonant frequencies. Although the vibration amplitudes were smaller in the cavities assembled with the titanium jacket, we could not find a clear reason for this., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Ab-initio Study of Atomic Scale Interaction Among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O, A.B. Tesfamichael, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, We employed a combination of ab-initio calculations and statistical mechanical models to understand the nature of atomic scale interaction among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O. Because of the profound nature of the interaction, we began our study by focusing only on the interaction of Nb with Sn in the absence of Cl and O. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we calculated: (1), binding energy of both vacant and interstitial of the super cell for both Nb and Sn atoms (2), rate of diffusion and re-evaporation upon transportation of Sn atom across z-axis from bulk Nb layer (3), electron transfer and electric field upon transportation of Sn atom both across z-axis and xy-plane from bulk Nb layer. Our calculation indicated 30-40% difference from experimental results. Therefore, we conclude that the presence of oxides is important and also Cl impurity can not not be avoided., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, N. Sitaraman, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, R.G. Farber, S.J. Sibener, R.D. Veit, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA, M. Liepe, J.T. Maniscalco, Cornell University (CLASSE), Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education, Ithaca, New York, USA, We develop and apply new tools to understand Nb surface chemistry and fundamental electronic processes using theoretical ab initio methods. We study the thermodynamics of impurities and hydrides in the near-surface region as well as their effect on the surface band gap. This makes it possible for experimentalists to relate changes in STM dI/dV measurements resulting from different preparations to changes in subsurface structure. We also calculate matrix elements for electron-impurity scattering in Nb for common impurities O, N, C, and H. By transforming these matrix elements into a Wannier function basis, we calculate lifetimes for a dense set of states on the Fermi surface and determine the mean free path as a function of impurity density.

To understand and to adapt these treatments for lower frequency, \beta < 1 cavities, two coaxial test cavities, one quarter-wave resonator (QWR) and one half-wave resonator (HWR), have been built and put through a systematic study of these new treatments to show the effectiveness of these treatments at different frequencies. These cavities are tested in their fundamental mode and several higher order modes to study the frequency dependence of new cavity treatments such as N2 doping and infusion.

Several models and experimental studies have been proposed and performed over the years to understand the origin of these anomalous losses but a general consensus on what these orgins are is yet to be established. In this contribution, we present the results from the RF tests of several 1.3 GHz single-cell cavities limited by the HFQS and tested using a variable input coupler. This allowed to maintain close to critical coupling even at high field and the data showed that the HFQS did not saturate and that in some cases a power dissipation of up to 200 W at 2 K could be sustained without quench., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, G. Ciovati, G. Cheng, E. Daly, G.V. Eremeev, J. Henry, R.A. Rimmer, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, ODU, Norfolk, Virginia, USA, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia, USA, Industrial application of SRF technology would favor the use of cryocoolers to conductively cool SRF cavities for particle accelerators, operating at or above 4.3 K. In order to achieve a lower surface resistance than Nb at 4.3 K, a superconductor with higher critical temperature should be used, whereas a metal with higher thermal conductivity than Nb should be used to conduct the heat to the cryocoolers. A standard 1.5 GHz bulk Nb single-cell cavity has been coated with a ~2 µm thick layer of Nb3Sn on the inner surface and with a 5 mm thick Cu layer on the outer surface for conduction cooled applications. The cavity performance has been measured at 4.3 K and 2.0 K in liquid He.

Here we report extensive numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under the strong rf magnetic field. The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force. We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases, Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields.

In this project, a new superconducting (SC) booster linac, so-called SRILAC, is being developed and constructed. The SRILAC consists of 10 TEM quarter-wavelength resonators made of pure niobium sheets which operate at 4 K. The target performance of each cavity is set as Q0 of 1×109 with its accelerating gradient of 6.8 MV/m. Recently we succeeded to develop high performance SC-cavities which satisfies the requirement with a wide margin. The cryomodule assembly is under way, and installation of cryomodules and He liquefaction system will be completed by the end of FY2018. The cooling-down test is scheduled in the Q1 of FY2019.

These modules are based on the ELBE modules of the Helmholtz Center Dresden-Rossendorf but are modified to suit the high current and energy-recovering operation at MESA. The energy gain per module per turn should be 25 MeV, provided by two TESLA cavities, which were vertically tested at DESY, Hamburg, Germany. These tests showed an excellent performance of the quench limit and quality factor for three out of the four cavities. The fourth cavity has a lower but still acceptable quench limit and quality factor. In order to validate the performance of the fully assembled cryomodules after delivery to Mainz a test stand has been set up at the Helmholtz Institut Mainz.

The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities. The original production material came from Two vendors Tokyo Denkai Co., Ltd. (TD) and Ningxia Orient Tantalum Industry Co., Ltd. (OTIC/NX)). It was found TD niobium required a lower annealing temperature (900°C) to obtain satisfactory flux expulsion characteristics compared to NX which required a slightly higher annealing temperature (950°-975°C). In order to ensure the new TD material performed equivalent to the niobium produced 4 year before after 900°C annealing; each heat lot of niobium had its flux expulsion characteristics parametrized and custom thermal treatments developed for each lot.

When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities.

   Title: SRF testing for Mainz Energy Recovering Superconducting Accelerator MESA
   Authors: T. Stengler, K. Aulenbacher, F. Hug, S.D.W. Thomas, KPH, Mainz, Germany, GSI, Darmstadt, Germany, HIM, Mainz, Germany, The two superconducting radio frequency acceleration cryomodules for the new multiturn ERL ’Mainz Energy Recovering Superconducting Accelerator’ MESA at Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz have been fabricated and are currently under testing at the Helmholtz Institut Mainz. These modules are based on the ELBE modules of the Helmholtz Center Dresden-Rossendorf but are modified to suit the high current and energy-recovering operation at MESA. The energy gain per module per turn should be 25 MeV, provided by two TESLA cavities, which were vertically tested at DESY, Hamburg, Germany. These tests showed an excellent performance of the quench limit and quality factor for three out of the four cavities. The fourth cavity has a lower but still acceptable quench limit and quality factor. In order to validate the performance of the fully assembled cryomodules after delivery to Mainz a test stand has been set up at the Helmholtz Institut Mainz. The test stand is described in detail and the status of the module testing is reported., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, O. Kamigaito, K. Ozeki, N. Sakamoto, K. Suda, K. Yamada, RIKEN Nishina Center, Wako, Japan, Mechanical vibration of quarter-wavelength resonators of SRILAC, the superconducting booster of the RIKEN heavy-ion linac, was measured during a vertical cold test.

   Title: Ab-initio Study of Atomic Scale Interaction Among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O
   Authors: A.B. Tesfamichael, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, We employed a combination of ab-initio calculations and statistical mechanical models to understand the nature of atomic scale interaction among Nb, Sn, Cl, and O. Because of the profound nature of the interaction, we began our study by focusing only on the interaction of Nb with Sn in the absence of Cl and O. Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) we calculated: (1), binding energy of both vacant and interstitial of the super cell for both Nb and Sn atoms (2), rate of diffusion and re-evaporation upon transportation of Sn atom across z-axis from bulk Nb layer (3), electron transfer and electric field upon transportation of Sn atom both across z-axis and xy-plane from bulk Nb layer. Our calculation indicated 30-40% difference from experimental results. Therefore, we conclude that the presence of oxides is important and also Cl impurity can not not be avoided., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, N. Sitaraman, T. Arias, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, USA, R.G. Farber, S.J. Sibener, R.D. Veit, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA, M. Liepe, J.T. Maniscalco, Cornell University (CLASSE), Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education, Ithaca, New York, USA, We develop and apply new tools to understand Nb surface chemistry and fundamental electronic processes using theoretical ab initio methods. We study the thermodynamics of impurities and hydrides in the near-surface region as well as their effect on the surface band gap. This makes it possible for experimentalists to relate changes in STM dI/dV measurements resulting from different preparations to changes in subsurface structure. We also calculate matrix elements for electron-impurity scattering in Nb for common impurities O, N, C, and H. By transforming these matrix elements into a Wannier function basis, we calculate lifetimes for a dense set of states on the Fermi surface and determine the mean free path as a function of impurity density.

   Title: A Multi-layered SRF Cavity for Conduction Cooling Applications

In order to achieve a lower surface resistance than Nb at 4.3 K, a superconductor with higher critical temperature should be used, whereas a metal with higher thermal conductivity than Nb should be used to conduct the heat to the cryocoolers. A standard 1.5 GHz bulk Nb single-cell cavity has been coated with a ~2 µm thick layer of Nb3Sn on the inner surface and with a 5 mm thick Cu layer on the outer surface for conduction cooled applications. The cavity performance has been measured at 4.3 K and 2.0 K in liquid He. The cavity reached a peak surface magnetic field of ~40 mT with a quality factor of 6×109 and 3.5×109 at 4.3 K, before and after applying the thick Cu layer, respectively., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, J.T. Maniscalco, T. Gruber, A.T. Holic, M. Liepe, Cornell University (CLASSE), Cornell Laboratory for Accelerator-Based Sciences and Education, Ithaca, New York, USA, The Cornell DC Field Dependence Cavity is a new coaxial test resonator designed to study the impact of strong (up to 200 mT or more) DC surface magnetic fields on the superconducting surface resistance, providing physical insight into the root of the ‘‘anti-Q-slope’’ and probing critical fields.

   Title: Design and Commissioning of a Magnetic Field Scanning System for SRF Cavities
   Authors: I.P. Parajuli, J.R. Delayen, A.V. Gurevich, J. Nice, ODU, Norfolk, Virginia, USA, G. Ciovati, W.A. Clemens, J.R. Delayen, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, Trapped magnetic vortices are one of the leading sources of residual losses in SRF cavities. Mechanisms of flux pinning depend on the materials treatment and cool-down conditions. A magnetic field scanning system using flux-gate magnetometers and Hall probes has been designed and built to allow measuring the local magnetic field of trapped vortices normal to the outer surface of 1.3 GHz single-cell SRF cavities at cryogenic temperatures. Such system will allow inferring the key information about the distribution and magnitude of trapped flux in the SRF cavities for different material, surface preparations and cool-down conditions., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, R.L. Geng, F. Marhauser, P.D. Owen, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS/IN2P3, IJCLab, Orsay, France, ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, M.R.P. Walive Pathiranage, A.V. Gurevich, ODU, Norfolk, Virginia, USA, Trapped vortices can contribute significantly to a residual surface resistance of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities but the nonlinear dynamics of flexible vortex lines driven by strong rf currents has not been well understood. Here we report extensive numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under the strong rf magnetic field. The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force. We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases, Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields. These results suggest that trapped vortices can contribute to the extended Q(H) rise observed on the SRF cavities., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, P. Garg, K.N. Solanki, Arizona State University, Tempe, USA, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA, NHMFL, Tallahassee, Florida, USA, Niobium is basis for all superconducting radio frequency cavities, a technology that accelerates charged particle beams to energy levels not possible by other means. When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities. The original production material came from Two vendors Tokyo Denkai Co., Ltd. (TD) and Ningxia Orient Tantalum Industry Co., Ltd. (OTIC/NX)). It was found TD niobium required a lower annealing temperature (900°C) to obtain satisfactory flux expulsion characteristics compared to NX which required a slightly higher annealing temperature (950°-975°C). In order to ensure the new TD material performed equivalent to the niobium produced 4 year before after 900°C annealing; each heat lot of niobium had its flux expulsion characteristics parametrized and custom thermal treatments developed for each lot.

   Title: Nonlinear Dynamics and Dissipation of Vortex Lines Driven by Strong RF Fields
   Authors: M.R.P. Walive Pathiranage, A.V. Gurevich, ODU, Norfolk, Virginia, USA, Trapped vortices can contribute significantly to a residual surface resistance of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities but the nonlinear dynamics of flexible vortex lines driven by strong rf currents has not been well understood. Here we report extensive numerical simulations of large-amplitude oscillations of a trapped vortex line under the strong rf magnetic field. The rf power dissipated by an oscillating vortex segment driven by the rf Meissner currents was calculated by taking into account the nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov and overheating viscous drag force. We calculated the field dependence of the surface resistance Rs and showed that at low frequencies Rs(H) increases with H but as the frequency increases, Rs(H) becomes a non-monotonic function of H which decreases with H at higher fields. These results suggest that trapped vortices can contribute to the extended Q(H) rise observed on the SRF cavities., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, P. Garg, K.N. Solanki, Arizona State University, Tempe, USA, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA, NHMFL, Tallahassee, Florida, USA, Niobium is basis for all superconducting radio frequency cavities, a technology that accelerates charged particle beams to energy levels not possible by other means. When cavities are pushed to limits, significant heating appears at extended material defects, like grain boundaries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how grain boundary (GB) structure and associated properties lead to trapping of magnetic field, and whether GB itself has any unusual magnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, external magnetic field along the GB plane was simulated within an all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave framework. A ground state with non-zero flux, indicative of flux trapping, was obtained at some grain boundaries, this outcome being influenced strongly by GB local structure. Furthermore, electronic density of states and charge-transfer calculations suggested non-zero spin polarization at grain boundaries, which may be consistent with recent observations of unusual paramagnetic magnetization as a function of specimen surface area for cavity-grade niobium., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, SLAC, Menlo Park, California, USA, O.S. Melnychuk, D.A. Sergatskov, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, During the LCLS-II project a second batch of niobium was procured from Tokyo Denkai Co Ltd in order to make additional cavities.

   Title: Investigation of Trapped Flux Dynamics via DC-Magnetic Quenching
   Authors: P. Nuñez von Voigt, J. Knobloch, O. Kugeler, HZB, Berlin, Germany, University of Siegen, Siegen, Germany, Trapped magnetic flux increases the surface resistance in superconducting radio-frequency cavities.

   Authors: F.Y. Yang, J. Dai, P. He, Z.Q. Li, Y. Ma, P. Zhang, IHEP, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, O.B. Malyshev, J.A. Conlon, P. Goudket, N. Pattalwar, S.M. Pattalwar, STFC/DL/ASTeC, Daresbury, Warrington, Cheshire, United Kingdom, Cockcroft Institute, Warrington, Cheshire, United Kingdom, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom, An ongoing programme of development superconducting thin film coating for SRF cavities requires a facility for a quick sample evaluation at the RF conditions. One of the key specifications is a simplicity of the testing procedure, allowing an easy installation and quick turnover of the testing samples. Choked test cavities operating at 7.8 GHz with three RF chokes have been designed and tested at DL in a LHe cryostat verifying that the system could perform as required. Having a sample and a cavity physically separate reduces the complexity involved in changing samples (major causes of low throughput rate and high running costs for other test cavities) and also allows direct measurement of the RF power dissipated in the sample via power calorimetry. However, changing a sample and preparation for a test requires about two-week effort per sample. In order to simplify the measurements and achieve a faster turnaround, a new cryostat cooled with a closed-cycle refrigerator has been designed, built and tested. Changing a sample, cooling down and testing can be reduced to 2-3 days per sample. Detailed design and results of testing of this facility will be reported at the conference., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, J. Dai, P. He, Z.Q. Li, Y. Ma, F.Y. Yang, P. Zhang, IHEP, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, A R&D program focusing on niobium sputtering on copper cavities started at IHEP in 2017.

Deposition of thin films on such scales in test facilities are challenging, in particular when curved surfaces have to be coated. This greatly complicates their systematic research.

Last year, two 325 MHz QWR copper cavities coated with biased DC diode sputterred Nb for CiADS has been accomplished at IMP. But vertical tests showed the cavities had low Q0 at 4 K.

Compared with traditional evaporation and sputtering, electrochemical coating has the advantages on process simplicity, low cost and mass production. However, the conventional electroplating, because of its low growth temperature and aqueous reaction environment, tends to produce porous, loosely bonded, and often contaminated film. All these properties result in excessive pinning center and deteriorate the superconducting radio frequency cavities performance. In this paper, a new method including multi-layer electroplating and heat treatment is used to deposit Nb3Sn thin film on top of copper substrates. Important growth parameters, e.g. electrical current density, layer thickness ratio, and annealing temperature are studied. The morphology of the film surfaces was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the structure of the film was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that a flat and uniform Nb3Sn layer on copper can be obtained, and the thickness is about 7 micron., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, R. Ito, T. Nagata, ULVAC, Inc, Chiba, Japan, H. Hayano, R. Katayama, T. Kubo, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, Sokendai, Ibaraki, Japan, Kyoto ICR, Uji, Kyoto, Japan, S-I-S (superconductor-insulator-superconductor) multilayered structure has been proposed in order to increase the maximum acceleration gradient of SRF cavities. Nb3Sn is the material most expected as a superconducting layer of the S-I-S multilayered structure because it offers both a large critical temperature and large predicted Hsh. Most important in fabricating Nb3Sn thin films is the stoichiometry of the material produced, and the lack of tin leads to performance degradation. We have launched a new in-house DC magnetron sputtering apparatus for Nb3Sn deposition. Nb and Sn layers were alternately and repeatedly deposited on Si wafer while adjusting the film thickness of each layer, so we successfully obtained Nb-Sn films having appropriate composition ratio. The as-deposited films were annealed under the temperature of 600 degree C for 1 hour to generate the Nb3Sn phase. The characteristics of Nb-Sn films evaluated by XRD, XRF, FE-SEM, and so on. We also measured critical temperature of the annealed films.

Gurevich to enhance the maximum gradient of SRF cavities. The lower critical field Hc1 at which the vortex start penetrating the superconducting material will be improved by coating Nb with thin film superconductor such as NbN. It is expected that the enhancement of Hc1 depends on the thickness of each layer. In order to determine the optimum thickness of each layer and to compare the measurement results with the theoretical prediction proposed by T. Kubo, we developed the Hc1 measurement system using the third harmonic response of the applied AC magnetic field at KEK. For the Hc1 measurement without the influence of the edge or the shape effects, the AC magnetic field can be applied locally by the solenoid coil of 5mm diameter in our measurement system.

The FTS allows controlling the penetration depth of plungers, which is monotonically related to the resonant frequency shift of the cavity. The developed FTS includes slow/fast tuner parts and is more compact and simple in comparison to traditional mechanical systems, which deform reversibly the HWR by applying an effort on the beam ports [2].

The results of numerical simulations of the resonant frequency for a wide range of plunger parameters are presented and discussed. The most important parameters for effective frequency shift are estimated.

Compared with traditional evaporation and sputtering, electrochemical coating has the advantages on process simplicity, low cost and mass production. However, the conventional electroplating, because of its low growth temperature and aqueous reaction environment, tends to produce porous, loosely bonded, and often contaminated film. All these properties result in excessive pinning center and deteriorate the superconducting radio frequency cavities performance. In this paper, a new method including multi-layer electroplating and heat treatment is used to deposit Nb3Sn thin film on top of copper substrates. Important growth parameters, e.g. electrical current density, layer thickness ratio, and annealing temperature are studied. The morphology of the film surfaces was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the structure of the film was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that a flat and uniform Nb3Sn layer on copper can be obtained, and the thickness is about 7 micron., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, R. Ito, T. Nagata, ULVAC, Inc, Chiba, Japan, H. Hayano, R. Katayama, T. Kubo, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, Sokendai, Ibaraki, Japan, Kyoto ICR, Uji, Kyoto, Japan, S-I-S (superconductor-insulator-superconductor) multilayered structure has been proposed in order to increase the maximum acceleration gradient of SRF cavities. Nb3Sn is the material most expected as a superconducting layer of the S-I-S multilayered structure because it offers both a large critical temperature and large predicted Hsh. Most important in fabricating Nb3Sn thin films is the stoichiometry of the material produced, and the lack of tin leads to performance degradation. We have launched a new in-house DC magnetron sputtering apparatus for Nb3Sn deposition. Nb and Sn layers were alternately and repeatedly deposited on Si wafer while adjusting the film thickness of each layer, so we successfully obtained Nb-Sn films having appropriate composition ratio. The as-deposited films were annealed under the temperature of 600 degree C for 1 hour to generate the Nb3Sn phase. The characteristics of Nb-Sn films evaluated by XRD, XRF, FE-SEM, and so on.

The lower critical field Hc1 at which the vortex start penetrating the superconducting material will be improved by coating Nb with thin film superconductor such as NbN. It is expected that the enhancement of Hc1 depends on the thickness of each layer. In order to determine the optimum thickness of each layer and to compare the measurement results with the theoretical prediction proposed by T.

The FTS allows controlling the penetration depth of plungers, which is monotonically related to the resonant frequency shift of the cavity. The developed FTS includes slow/fast tuner parts and is more compact and simple in comparison to traditional mechanical systems, which deform reversibly the HWR by applying an effort on the beam ports [2]. The similar plunger-based tuner design was considered for QWR cavities in [3]. The results of numerical simulations of the resonant frequency for a wide range of plunger parameters are presented and discussed. The most important parameters for effective frequency shift are estimated.

   Title: Superconducting Thin Films Characterization at HZB with the Quadrupole Resonator
   Authors: D.B. Tikhonov, S. Keckert, J. Knobloch, O. Kugeler, Y. Tamashevich, HZB, Berlin, Germany, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, Superconducting thin films have great potential as post-Nb material for use in SRF applications in future accelerators and industry. To test the RF-performance of such films in practice, would require the building and coating of a full RF cavity. Deposition of thin films on such scales in test facilities are challenging, in particular when curved surfaces have to be coated. This greatly complicates their systematic research. In this contribution we report on the method we use to characterize small and flat thin film samples (Deposited onto both Nb and Cu substrates) in an actual cavity named the Quadrupole Resonator (QPR). We also summarize the latest measurement results of NbTiN thin films.

   Title: Electrochemical Deposition of  Nb3Sn on the Surface of Cu Substrates
   Authors: M. Lu, Q.W. Chu, Y. He, Z.Q. Lin, F. Pan, T. Tan, Z.Q. Yang, IMP/CAS, Lanzhou, People’s Republic of China, Coating superconducting Nb3Sn thin film on the inner surface of a superconducting RF cavity is one of the most promising approaches to improve the performance of the accelerating cavity. Compared with traditional evaporation and sputtering, electrochemical coating has the advantages on process simplicity, low cost and mass production. However, the conventional electroplating, because of its low growth temperature and aqueous reaction environment, tends to produce porous, loosely bonded, and often contaminated film. All these properties result in excessive pinning center and deteriorate the superconducting radio frequency cavities performance. In this paper, a new method including multi-layer electroplating and heat treatment is used to deposit Nb3Sn thin film on top of copper substrates. Important growth parameters, e.g. electrical current density, layer thickness ratio, and annealing temperature are studied. The morphology of the film surfaces was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the structure of the film was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that a flat and uniform Nb3Sn layer on copper can be obtained, and the thickness is about 7 micron., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, R. Ito, T. Nagata, ULVAC, Inc, Chiba, Japan, H. Hayano, R. Katayama, T. Kubo, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, Sokendai, Ibaraki, Japan, Kyoto ICR, Uji, Kyoto, Japan, S-I-S (superconductor-insulator-superconductor) multilayered structure has been proposed in order to increase the maximum acceleration gradient of SRF cavities. Nb3Sn is the material most expected as a superconducting layer of the S-I-S multilayered structure because it offers both a large critical temperature and large predicted Hsh. Most important in fabricating Nb3Sn thin films is the stoichiometry of the material produced, and the lack of tin leads to performance degradation. We have launched a new in-house DC magnetron sputtering apparatus for Nb3Sn deposition. Nb and Sn layers were alternately and repeatedly deposited on Si wafer while adjusting the film thickness of each layer, so we successfully obtained Nb-Sn films having appropriate composition ratio. The as-deposited films were annealed under the temperature of 600 degree C for 1 hour to generate the Nb3Sn phase. The characteristics of Nb-Sn films evaluated by XRD, XRF, FE-SEM, and so on. We also measured critical temperature of the annealed films. In this paper, the detail of the Nb3Sn coating method and the measurement result of the Nb-Sn films will be reported., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Sokendai, Ibaraki, Japan, CEA-IRFU, Gif-sur-Yvette, France, H. Hayano, R. Katayama, T. Kubo, T. Saeki, KEK, Ibaraki, Japan, R. Ito, T. Nagata, ULVAC, Inc, Chiba, Japan, Y. Iwashita, H. Tongu, Kyoto ICR, Uji, Kyoto, Japan, The multilayer thin film structure of the superconductor has been proposed by A. Gurevich to enhance the maximum gradient of SRF cavities. The lower critical field Hc1 at which the vortex start penetrating the superconducting material will be improved by coating Nb with thin film superconductor such as NbN. It is expected that the enhancement of Hc1 depends on the thickness of each layer. In order to determine the optimum thickness of each layer and to compare the measurement results with the theoretical prediction proposed by T. Kubo, we developed the Hc1 measurement system using the third harmonic response of the applied AC magnetic field at KEK. For the Hc1 measurement without the influence of the edge or the shape effects, the AC magnetic field can be applied locally by the solenoid coil of 5mm diameter in our measurement system.

   Title: Deposition of Nb3Sn Films by Multilayer Sequential Sputtering for SRF Cavity Application
   Authors: Md.N. Sayeed, H. Elsayed-Ali, ODU, Norfolk, Virginia, USA, M.C. Burton, G.V. Eremeev, C.E. Reece, A-M. Valente-Feliciano, JLab, Newport News, Virginia, USA, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia, USA, Nb3Sn is considered as an alternative of Nb for SRF accelerator cavity application due to its potential to obtain higher quality factors and higher accelerating gradients at a higher operating temperature. Magnetron sputtering is one of the effective techniques that can be used to fabricate Nb3Sn on SRF cavity surface. We report on the surface properties of Nb3Sn films fabricated by sputtering multiple layers of Nb and Sn on sapphire and niobium substrates followed by annealing at 950°C for 3 h. The crystal structure, film microstructure, composition and surface roughness were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The RF performance of the Nb3Sn coated Nb substrates were measured by a surface impedance characterization system. We also report on the design of a multilayer sputter deposition system to coat a single-cell SRF cavity., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, Z.H. Mi, Z.Q. Li, H.Y. Lin, W.M. Pan, Q.Y. Wang, P. Zhang, X.Y. Zhang, H.J. Zheng, IHEP, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, The 166.6 MHz superconducting RF cavities have been proposed for the High Energy Photon Source (HEPS), a 6 GeV kilometer-scale light source.

Both active components of the tuner: electromechanical actuator (stepper motor) and piezo-actuators are operated inside superfluid helium. Accuracy in controlling the SRF cavity resonance frequency will be presented. Specifics of the tuner operation when submerged into liquid He will be discussed., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, D. Bychanok, S. Huseu, S.A. Maksimenko, INP BSU, Minsk, Belarus, A.V. Butenko, E. Syresin, JINR, Dubna, Moscow Region, Russia, Belarussian State University, Scientific Research Institute of Nuclear Problems, Minsk, Belarus, M. Gusarova, M.V. Lalayan, S.M. Polozov, MEPhI, Moscow, Russia, The design of a prototype of the frequency tuning system (FTS) for superconductive coaxial half wave cavities (HWR) [1] developed for the Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) injector is presented. The proposed system is based on mobile plungers placed in the technological holes in the end caps of the resonator. The FTS allows controlling the penetration depth of plungers, which is monotonically related to the resonant frequency shift of the cavity. The developed FTS includes slow/fast tuner parts and is more compact and simple in comparison to traditional mechanical systems, which deform reversibly the HWR by applying an effort on the beam ports [2].

   Title: Development and Performances of Spoke Cavity Tuner for MYRRHA Linac Project
   Authors: N. Gandolfo, S. Blivet, P. Duchesne, D. Le Dréan, Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS/IN2P3, IJCLab, Orsay, France, In the framework of the Multi-purpose hYbrid Research Reactor for High-tech Applications (MYRRHA) 100 MeV linac construction, a fully equipped prototype cryomodule is being developed. In order to control the resonance frequency of the cavities during operation, a tuner has been studied with the specific requirements: high degree of reliability and high tuning speed. This paper reports the design consideration and the first performances measurement in vertical cryostat test at an early stage of the prototyping phase., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, M. Xu, H. Ao, B. Bird, R. Bliton, C. Compton, J. Curtin, L. Hodges, K. Holland, S.J. Miller, K. Saitopresenter, T. Xu, C. Zhang, FRIB, East Lansing, Michigan, USA, The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is a heavy ion accelerator that produces rare isotopes for science. To achieve the high beam quality of FRIB¿s linear accelera-tor (linac), the superconducting solenoid packages are employed for beam focusing and steering in the cry-omodule. The solenoid packages will generate a maxi-mum 8T focusing field along beam direction and 0.124 T bending field for beam steering. A total 74 solenoid packages have been produced and the first segment linac (LS1) of FRIB have completed commissioning and beam acceleration. In this paper, the cryomodule¿s solenoid commissioning and the performance of the LS1 linac are introduced. The lessons learned during the testing will also be presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, K. Elliott, B.W. Barker, C. Donald, E.S. Metzgar, L. Popielarskipresenter, D.R. Victory, J.D. Whaley, M.S. Wilbur, FRIB, East Lansing, Michigan, USA, The superconducting radio frequency (SRF) portion of the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) linear accelerator consists of 46 cryomodules of 6 different types. Each cryomodule contains a coldmass consisting of a string of SRF resonators. There are four different types of resonators; a β=0.041 quarter wavelength resonator (QWR), a β=0.085 QWR, a β=0.29 half wavelength resonator (HWR), and a β=0.53 HWR.

A total of 35 cryomodules will be fabricated at Jefferson Lab (JLab) in Virginia and Fermi National Laboratory (FNAL) in Illinois and transported via road to SLAC. A shipping frame with an inner bed isolated by springs was designed to protect the CMs from shocks and vibrations during shipments. Successful road testing of the JLab prototype paved the way for production CM shipments. The initial production shipments lead to several catastrophic failures in beamline vacuum in the cryomodules. The failures were determined to be due to fatigue in Fundamental Power Coupler (FPC) bellows due to excessive motion during shipment. A series of instrumented CM shipping tests and component tests were undertaken to develop a solution. A modified spring layout was tested and implemented, which reduced shocks on the CMs. FPC coupler bellows restraints were tested on a shaker table and on a CM during shipping; they were able to reduce bellows motion by a factor of three.

A total of 35 cryomodules will be fabricated at Jefferson Lab (JLab) in Virginia and Fermi National Laboratory (FNAL) in Illinois and transported via road to SLAC. A shipping frame with an inner bed isolated by springs was designed to protect the CMs from shocks and vibrations during shipments. Successful road testing of the JLab prototype paved the way for production CM shipments. The initial production shipments lead to several catastrophic failures in beamline vacuum in the cryomodules. The failures were determined to be due to fatigue in Fundamental Power Coupler (FPC) bellows due to excessive motion during shipment. A series of instrumented CM shipping tests and component tests were undertaken to develop a solution. A modified spring layout was tested and implemented, which reduced shocks on the CMs. FPC coupler bellows restraints were tested on a shaker table and on a CM during shipping; they were able to reduce bellows motion by a factor of three. The updated shipping system is currently in use and has successfully delivered six cryomodules to SLAC from JLab and FNAL., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, D. Passarelli, D.J. Bice, M. Parise, T.J. Ring, G. Wu, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, CEA-DRF-IRFU, France, The string assembly of the prototype Single Spoke Resonator type 1 (SSR1) cryomodule for PIP-II at Fermilab was successfully completed.

A test experiment was set up of the photocathode cooling system based on the original components, which we call thermal contact experiment (TCX). We present the results of our thermal load studies on the photocathode insert with exchangeable photocathode plug. The goal was to test all components before they are installed in the cold string of the BERLinPro SRF-Photoinjector to ensure the operation of very sensitive semiconductor photocathodes. The tests include the investigation of the cooling performance, the thermal load management and the mechanical stability of the photocathode insert., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, T.T. Arkan, J.N. Blowers, C.M. Ginsburg, C.J. Grimm, J.A. Kaluzny, T.H. Nicol, Y.O. Orlov, K.S. Premo, R.P. Stanek, G. Wu, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, LCLS-II is a planned upgrade project for the linear coherent light source (LCLS) at SLAC. The LCLS-II Linac will consist of thirty-five 1.3 GHz and two 3.9 GHz superconducting RF continuous wave (CW) cryomodules that Fermilab and Jefferson Lab are currently producing in collaboration with SLAC. The LCLS-II 1.3 GHz cryomodule design is based on the European XFEL pulsed-mode cryomodule design with modifications needed for CW operation. Two prototype cryomodules had been assembled and tested. After prototype cryomodule tests, both laboratories have increased their cryomodule production rate to meet the challenging LCLS-II project installation schedule requirements of approximately one cryomodule per month per laboratory. To date, Fermilab has completed the assembly and testing of sixteen 1.3 GHz cryomodules. Fermilab has successfully shipped five CMs to SLAC and will continue to ship with a two-week throughput. The first 3.9 GHz cryomodule assembly is scheduled to start in June 2019; production readiness verifications are in progress. This paper presents LCLS-II cryomodule assembly and production experience, emphasizing the challenges, the mitigations and lessons learned, ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, M.P. Kelly, Z.A. Conway, M. Kedzie, S.W.T. MacDonald, T. Reid, U. Wienands, G.P. Zinkann, ANL, Lemont, Illinois, USA, A superconducting cavity based Bunch Lengthening System is under construction for the Argonne’s Advanced Photon Source (APS) Upgrade. The system will reduce the undesirable effects of Touschek scattering on the beam lifetime by providing bunch lengthening in the longitudinal direction by 2-4 times. The major technical components for the beam-driven 1.4 GHz fourth harmonic superconducting cryomodule are in hand and have been tested. These include a superconducting cavity, cw rf power couplers, a pneumatic cavity slow tuner and beamline higher-order mode absorbers. Initial assembly and engineering testing of the cryomodule is underway. Final integrated testing will be complete in 2021.

From its inception in 2000, when data collection was a priority for such projects as SNS, CEBAF 12GeV upgrade, LCLS-II, and in the future the SNS-PPU, the focus has turned to data analysis and reporting on quality metrics and key performance indica-tors (KPIs). Reporting enhancements include monthly quality metrics, project specific KPIs, and trending across projects.

   Title: LCLS-II Cryomodules Production Experience and Lessons Learned at Fermilab
   Authors: T.T. Arkan, J.N. Blowers, C.M. Ginsburg, C.J. Grimm, J.A. Kaluzny, T.H. Nicol, Y.O. Orlov, K.S. Premo, R.P. Stanek, G. Wu, Fermilab, Batavia, Illinois, USA, LCLS-II is a planned upgrade project for the linear coherent light source (LCLS) at SLAC. The LCLS-II Linac will consist of thirty-five 1.3 GHz and two 3.9 GHz superconducting RF continuous wave (CW) cryomodules that Fermilab and Jefferson Lab are currently producing in collaboration with SLAC. The LCLS-II 1.3 GHz cryomodule design is based on the European XFEL pulsed-mode cryomodule design with modifications needed for CW operation. Two prototype cryomodules had been assembled and tested. After prototype cryomodule tests, both laboratories have increased their cryomodule production rate to meet the challenging LCLS-II project installation schedule requirements of approximately one cryomodule per month per laboratory. To date, Fermilab has completed the assembly and testing of sixteen 1.3 GHz cryomodules. Fermilab has successfully shipped five CMs to SLAC and will continue to ship with a two-week throughput. The first 3.9 GHz cryomodule assembly is scheduled to start in June 2019; production readiness verifications are in progress. This paper presents LCLS-II cryomodule assembly and production experience, emphasizing the challenges, the mitigations and lessons learned, ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS, M.P. Kelly, Z.A. Conway, M. Kedzie, S.W.T. MacDonald, T. Reid, U. Wienands, G.P. Zinkann, ANL, Lemont, Illinois, USA, A superconducting cavity based Bunch Lengthening System is under construction for the Argonne’s Advanced Photon Source (APS) Upgrade. The system will reduce the undesirable effects of Touschek scattering on the beam lifetime by providing bunch lengthening in the longitudinal direction by 2-4 times.

   Title: Mechanical Tuner for a 325 MHz Balloon Single Spoke Resonator
   Authors: R.E. Laxdal, J.J. Keir, B. Matheson, N. Muller, Z.Y. Yao, TRIUMF, Vancouver, Canada, TRIUMF has designed, fabricated and tested the first balloon variant of the single spoke resonator at 325 MHz and β=0.3. TRIUMF has also designed and built a mechanical tuner as part of the development. The tuner employs a nutcracker lever pressing at the beam ports driven by a scissor jack. The scissor is actuated through a tube coupling to a warm ball-screw and servo-motor located outside the cryostat. The design and warm tests of the tuner will be presented., ※ BibTeX, ※ LaTeX, ※ Text/Word, ※ RIS
