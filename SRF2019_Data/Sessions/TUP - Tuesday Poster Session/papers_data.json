We have earlier reported on a VEP parameter study for 1.3 GHz single and nine-cell Nb cavities. The optimized VEP parameters and a unique rotating cathode yielded uniform removal and a smooth surface in the single cell cavity. The unique cathode and a dual flow mechanism for acid circulation were applied to improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. The vertically electropolished single and nine cell cavities achieved the same RF performance as achieved after the HEP processes. We are making efforts to further improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. Here",

The VEP results reveal that the speed could be considered for improving the uniformity in removal while maintaining the surface smoothness. Required improvements in the VEP facility and acid flow condition for achieving uniform EP and a smooth surface are also described.",

The cavities have a reduced frequency due to additional material removal during cavity treatment well beyond the baseline recipe. The mechanical condition of the cavities was relatively soft because of the thermal history and the niobium manufacture requirement of an optimal flux expulsion. The niobium was highly recrystallized by 3 hours annealing at 900°C and 975°C respectively. Each cavity received an inner surface treatment of 200 µm electro-polishing (EP) and an external 30 µm buffered chemical polishing (BCP) as part of the baseline recipe. Each cavity received an addition ~100 µm of chemical removal along with a second annealing treatment before the radial tuning process. Detailed information about the accuracy and homogeneity of LCLS-II cavities rolling is presented as well as results of field distribution analysis for TM011 zero-mode with a comparison to standard cavities.

Gradient for Flux Expulsion in 600°C Heat-treated CEBAF 12 GeV Upgrade Cavities We will present results on measurement of flux expulsion in CEBAF 12 GeV upgrade cavities and original CEBAF cavities and the search for optimal thermal gradient for reducing the trapped flux in cavities installed in CEBAF linacs. Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities. These results could lead to a cost-effective path for improving the quality factor of cavities installed in CEBAF and ultimately saving accelerator operation cost. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP053 paper received ※ 24 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 29 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using How Is Flux Expulsion Affected by Geometry: Experimental Evidence and Model Measurements of magnetic sensitivity to trapped flux on several type of cavity geometries have been performed at IPNO showing a clear geometrical effect.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons. A modified design of the pickup antenna have solved the PT pickup trip problem. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP064 paper received ※ 23 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 04 July 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using New Design of SSR2 Spoke Cavity for PIP II SRF Linac reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP066 paper received ※ 21 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 01 July 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using Plasma Processing to Reduce Field Emission in LCLS-II 1.3 GHz SRF Cavities",

To keep the UNILAC user program competitive a new superconducting (sc) continuous wave (cw) high intensity heavy ion LINAC should provide ion beams with max. duty factor above the coulomb barrier. The fundamental sc LINAC design comprises a low energy beam transport (LEBT)-section followed by a sc Drift Tube Linac (DTL) consisting of sc Crossbar-H-mode (CH) structures for acceleration up to 7.3 MeV/u. The latest milestones towards the new cw LINAC HELIAC (HELmholtz LInear ACcelerator) have been the successful tests and commissioning of the first demonstrator section with heavy ion beam in 2017 and 218 as well as the successful test under cryogenic conditions of the second CH-cavity in 2018. Now the third CH-cavity has been tested at cryogenic temperatures of 4 Kelvin at the Institute for Applied Physics (IAP) at Goethe University Frankfurt (GUF). The results of these measurements as well as the status of the HELIAC-project will be presented.",

The cavities have a reduced frequency due to additional material removal during cavity treatment well beyond the baseline recipe. The mechanical condition of the cavities was relatively soft because of the thermal history and the niobium manufacture requirement of an optimal flux expulsion. The niobium was highly recrystallized by 3 hours annealing at 900°C and 975°C respectively. Each cavity received an inner surface treatment of 200 µm electro-polishing (EP) and an external 30 µm buffered chemical polishing (BCP) as part of the baseline recipe. Each cavity received an addition ~100 µm of chemical removal along with a second annealing treatment before the radial tuning process.

Gradient for Flux Expulsion in 600°C Heat-treated CEBAF 12 GeV Upgrade Cavities We will present results on measurement of flux expulsion in CEBAF 12 GeV upgrade cavities and original CEBAF cavities and the search for optimal thermal gradient for reducing the trapped flux in cavities installed in CEBAF linacs. Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities. These results could lead to a cost-effective path for improving the quality factor of cavities installed in CEBAF and ultimately saving accelerator operation cost. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP053 paper received ※ 24 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 29 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using How Is Flux Expulsion Affected by Geometry: Experimental Evidence and Model Measurements of magnetic sensitivity to trapped flux on several type of cavity geometries have been performed at IPNO showing a clear geometrical effect.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons.

The cavities have a reduced frequency due to additional material removal during cavity treatment well beyond the baseline recipe. The mechanical condition of the cavities was relatively soft because of the thermal history and the niobium manufacture requirement of an optimal flux expulsion. The niobium was highly recrystallized by 3 hours annealing at 900°C and 975°C respectively. Each cavity received an inner surface treatment of 200 µm electro-polishing (EP) and an external 30 µm buffered chemical polishing (BCP) as part of the baseline recipe. Each cavity received an addition ~100 µm of chemical removal along with a second annealing treatment before the radial tuning process. Detailed information about the accuracy and homogeneity of LCLS-II cavities rolling is presented as well as results of field distribution analysis for TM011 zero-mode with a comparison to standard cavities.

and the search for optimal thermal gradient for reducing the trapped flux in cavities installed in CEBAF linacs. Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities. These results could lead to a cost-effective path for improving the quality factor of cavities installed in CEBAF and ultimately saving accelerator operation cost. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP053 paper received ※ 24 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 29 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using How Is Flux Expulsion Affected by Geometry: Experimental Evidence and Model Measurements of magnetic sensitivity to trapped flux on several type of cavity geometries have been performed at IPNO showing a clear geometrical effect.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons. A modified design of the pickup antenna have solved the PT pickup trip problem. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP064 paper received ※ 23 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 04 July 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using New Design of SSR2 Spoke Cavity for PIP II SRF Linac reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP066 paper received ※ 21 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 01 July 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using Plasma Processing to Reduce Field Emission in LCLS-II 1.3 GHz SRF Cavities",

The cavities have a reduced frequency due to additional material removal during cavity treatment well beyond the baseline recipe. The mechanical condition of the cavities was relatively soft because of the thermal history and the niobium manufacture requirement of an optimal flux expulsion. The niobium was highly recrystallized by 3 hours annealing at 900°C and 975°C respectively. Each cavity received an inner surface treatment of 200 µm electro-polishing (EP) and an external 30 µm buffered chemical polishing (BCP) as part of the baseline recipe. Each cavity received an addition ~100 µm of chemical removal along with a second annealing treatment before the radial tuning process. Detailed information about the accuracy and homogeneity of LCLS-II cavities rolling is presented as well as results of field distribution analysis for TM011 zero-mode with a comparison to standard cavities.

Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons.

The cavities have a reduced frequency due to additional material removal during cavity treatment well beyond the baseline recipe. The mechanical condition of the cavities was relatively soft because of the thermal history and the niobium manufacture requirement of an optimal flux expulsion. The niobium was highly recrystallized by 3 hours annealing at 900°C and 975°C respectively. Each cavity received an inner surface treatment of 200 µm electro-polishing (EP) and an external 30 µm buffered chemical polishing (BCP) as part of the baseline recipe. Each cavity received an addition ~100 µm of chemical removal along with a second annealing treatment before the radial tuning process. Detailed information about the accuracy and homogeneity of LCLS-II cavities rolling is presented as well as results of field distribution analysis for TM011 zero-mode with a comparison to standard cavities.

Gradient for Flux Expulsion in 600°C Heat-treated CEBAF 12 GeV Upgrade Cavities We will present results on measurement of flux expulsion in CEBAF 12 GeV upgrade cavities and original CEBAF cavities and the search for optimal thermal gradient for reducing the trapped flux in cavities installed in CEBAF linacs. Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities. These results could lead to a cost-effective path for improving the quality factor of cavities installed in CEBAF and ultimately saving accelerator operation cost. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP053 paper received ※ 24 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 29 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using How Is Flux Expulsion Affected by Geometry: Experimental Evidence and Model Measurements of magnetic sensitivity to trapped flux on several type of cavity geometries have been performed at IPNO showing a clear geometrical effect.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization.

The cavities have a reduced frequency due to additional material removal during cavity treatment well beyond the baseline recipe. The mechanical condition of the cavities was relatively soft because of the thermal history and the niobium manufacture requirement of an optimal flux expulsion. The niobium was highly recrystallized by 3 hours annealing at 900°C and 975°C respectively. Each cavity received an inner surface treatment of 200 µm electro-polishing (EP) and an external 30 µm buffered chemical polishing (BCP) as part of the baseline recipe. Each cavity received an addition ~100 µm of chemical removal along with a second annealing treatment before the radial tuning process.

and the search for optimal thermal gradient for reducing the trapped flux in cavities installed in CEBAF linacs. Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities. These results could lead to a cost-effective path for improving the quality factor of cavities installed in CEBAF and ultimately saving accelerator operation cost. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP053 paper received ※ 24 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 29 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using How Is Flux Expulsion Affected by Geometry: Experimental Evidence and Model Measurements of magnetic sensitivity to trapped flux on several type of cavity geometries have been performed at IPNO showing a clear geometrical effect.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons.

The optimized VEP parameters and a unique rotating cathode yielded uniform removal and a smooth surface in the single cell cavity. The unique cathode and a dual flow mechanism for acid circulation were applied to improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. The vertically electropolished single and nine cell cavities achieved the same RF performance as achieved after the HEP processes. We are making efforts to further improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. Here",
        "we report on a VEP of the 1.3 GHz Nb nine-cell cavity at a higher cathode rotation speed of 50 rpm. The VEP results reveal that the speed could be considered for improving the uniformity in removal while maintaining the surface smoothness. Required improvements in the VEP facility and acid flow condition for achieving uniform EP and a smooth surface are also described.",

The cavities have a reduced frequency due to additional material removal during cavity treatment well beyond the baseline recipe. The mechanical condition of the cavities was relatively soft because of the thermal history and the niobium manufacture requirement of an optimal flux expulsion. The niobium was highly recrystallized by 3 hours annealing at 900°C and 975°C respectively. Each cavity received an inner surface treatment of 200 µm electro-polishing (EP) and an external 30 µm buffered chemical polishing (BCP) as part of the baseline recipe. Each cavity received an addition ~100 µm of chemical removal along with a second annealing treatment before the radial tuning process. Detailed information about the accuracy and homogeneity of LCLS-II cavities rolling is presented as well as results of field distribution analysis for TM011 zero-mode with a comparison to standard cavities.

and the search for optimal thermal gradient for reducing the trapped flux in cavities installed in CEBAF linacs. Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities. These results could lead to a cost-effective path for improving the quality factor of cavities installed in CEBAF and ultimately saving accelerator operation cost. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP053 paper received ※ 24 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 29 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using How Is Flux Expulsion Affected by Geometry: Experimental Evidence and Model Measurements of magnetic sensitivity to trapped flux on several type of cavity geometries have been performed at IPNO showing a clear geometrical effect.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons. A modified design of the pickup antenna have solved the PT pickup trip problem. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP064 paper received ※ 23 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 04 July 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using New Design of SSR2 Spoke Cavity for PIP II SRF Linac reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP066 paper received ※ 21 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 01 July 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using Plasma Processing to Reduce Field Emission in LCLS-II 1.3 GHz SRF Cavities",

Different aspects of the tuning procedure and material properties are described using the example of cavity rolling.",

The cavities have a reduced frequency due to additional material removal during cavity treatment well beyond the baseline recipe. The mechanical condition of the cavities was relatively soft because of the thermal history and the niobium manufacture requirement of an optimal flux expulsion. The niobium was highly recrystallized by 3 hours annealing at 900°C and 975°C respectively. Each cavity received an inner surface treatment of 200 µm electro-polishing (EP) and an external 30 µm buffered chemical polishing (BCP) as part of the baseline recipe. Each cavity received an addition ~100 µm of chemical removal along with a second annealing treatment before the radial tuning process. Detailed information about the accuracy and homogeneity of LCLS-II cavities rolling is presented as well as results of field distribution analysis for TM011 zero-mode with a comparison to standard cavities.

and the search for optimal thermal gradient for reducing the trapped flux in cavities installed in CEBAF linacs. Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities. These results could lead to a cost-effective path for improving the quality factor of cavities installed in CEBAF and ultimately saving accelerator operation cost. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP053 paper received ※ 24 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 29 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using How Is Flux Expulsion Affected by Geometry: Experimental Evidence and Model Measurements of magnetic sensitivity to trapped flux on several type of cavity geometries have been performed at IPNO showing a clear geometrical effect.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons.

Stable ultra-high vacuum (<10-8 Pa) and particulate-free conditions are strictly necessary for keeping the performance of the superconductive radio frequency (SRF) cavities of the SRILAC. It is crucially important to develop neighboring warm sections to prevent contamination from the existing old RILAC and beamlines built almost four decades ago. In the present study",

The cavities have a reduced frequency due to additional material removal during cavity treatment well beyond the baseline recipe. The mechanical condition of the cavities was relatively soft because of the thermal history and the niobium manufacture requirement of an optimal flux expulsion. The niobium was highly recrystallized by 3 hours annealing at 900°C and 975°C respectively. Each cavity received an inner surface treatment of 200 µm electro-polishing (EP) and an external 30 µm buffered chemical polishing (BCP) as part of the baseline recipe. Each cavity received an addition ~100 µm of chemical removal along with a second annealing treatment before the radial tuning process. Detailed information about the accuracy and homogeneity of LCLS-II cavities rolling is presented as well as results of field distribution analysis for TM011 zero-mode with a comparison to standard cavities.

and the search for optimal thermal gradient for reducing the trapped flux in cavities installed in CEBAF linacs. Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities. These results could lead to a cost-effective path for improving the quality factor of cavities installed in CEBAF and ultimately saving accelerator operation cost. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP053 paper received ※ 24 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 29 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using How Is Flux Expulsion Affected by Geometry: Experimental Evidence and Model Measurements of magnetic sensitivity to trapped flux on several type of cavity geometries have been performed at IPNO showing a clear geometrical effect.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons. A modified design of the pickup antenna have solved the PT pickup trip problem. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP064 paper received ※ 23 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 04 July 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using New Design of SSR2 Spoke Cavity for PIP II SRF Linac reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP066 paper received ※ 21 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 01 July 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using Plasma Processing to Reduce Field Emission in LCLS-II 1.3 GHz SRF Cavities",

We have earlier reported on a VEP parameter study for 1.3 GHz single and nine-cell Nb cavities. The optimized VEP parameters and a unique rotating cathode yielded uniform removal and a smooth surface in the single cell cavity. The unique cathode and a dual flow mechanism for acid circulation were applied to improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. The vertically electropolished single and nine cell cavities achieved the same RF performance as achieved after the HEP processes. We are making efforts to further improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. Here",

Each cavity received an inner surface treatment of 200 µm electro-polishing (EP) and an external 30 µm buffered chemical polishing (BCP) as part of the baseline recipe. Each cavity received an addition ~100 µm of chemical removal along with a second annealing treatment before the radial tuning process. Detailed information about the accuracy and homogeneity of LCLS-II cavities rolling is presented as well as results of field distribution analysis for TM011 zero-mode with a comparison to standard cavities.

and the search for optimal thermal gradient for reducing the trapped flux in cavities installed in CEBAF linacs. Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities. These results could lead to a cost-effective path for improving the quality factor of cavities installed in CEBAF and ultimately saving accelerator operation cost. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP053 paper received ※ 24 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 29 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using How Is Flux Expulsion Affected by Geometry: Experimental Evidence and Model Measurements of magnetic sensitivity to trapped flux on several type of cavity geometries have been performed at IPNO showing a clear geometrical effect.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons.

The cavities have a reduced frequency due to additional material removal during cavity treatment well beyond the baseline recipe. The mechanical condition of the cavities was relatively soft because of the thermal history and the niobium manufacture requirement of an optimal flux expulsion. The niobium was highly recrystallized by 3 hours annealing at 900°C and 975°C respectively. Each cavity received an inner surface treatment of 200 µm electro-polishing (EP) and an external 30 µm buffered chemical polishing (BCP) as part of the baseline recipe. Each cavity received an addition ~100 µm of chemical removal along with a second annealing treatment before the radial tuning process.

and the search for optimal thermal gradient for reducing the trapped flux in cavities installed in CEBAF linacs. Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities. These results could lead to a cost-effective path for improving the quality factor of cavities installed in CEBAF and ultimately saving accelerator operation cost. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP053 paper received ※ 24 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 29 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using How Is Flux Expulsion Affected by Geometry: Experimental Evidence and Model Measurements of magnetic sensitivity to trapped flux on several type of cavity geometries have been performed at IPNO showing a clear geometrical effect.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization.

The cavities have a reduced frequency due to additional material removal during cavity treatment well beyond the baseline recipe. The mechanical condition of the cavities was relatively soft because of the thermal history and the niobium manufacture requirement of an optimal flux expulsion. The niobium was highly recrystallized by 3 hours annealing at 900°C and 975°C respectively. Each cavity received an inner surface treatment of 200 µm electro-polishing (EP) and an external 30 µm buffered chemical polishing (BCP) as part of the baseline recipe. Each cavity received an addition ~100 µm of chemical removal along with a second annealing treatment before the radial tuning process. Detailed information about the accuracy and homogeneity of LCLS-II cavities rolling is presented as well as results of field distribution analysis for TM011 zero-mode with a comparison to standard cavities.

Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities.

Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed.

This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz. Results of the modal analysis as well as the background microphonics observed when operated under various cryogenic conditions and with different modifications will be presented.",

Radial deformation of cavity cells can be provided by a special chain or a rolling device with three rollers. The chain distributes the radial forces on the equator area around the cell. The rollers are moving radially in relation to the rotating cavity and provide an equator diameter reduction. Both devices have the contour close to the cell shape at the equator area. The required equator radius deviation depends on the tuning target and usually varies between (0.02…0.60) mm.

The cavities have a reduced frequency due to additional material removal during cavity treatment well beyond the baseline recipe. The mechanical condition of the cavities was relatively soft because of the thermal history and the niobium manufacture requirement of an optimal flux expulsion. The niobium was highly recrystallized by 3 hours annealing at 900°C and 975°C respectively. Each cavity received an inner surface treatment of 200 µm electro-polishing (EP) and an external 30 µm buffered chemical polishing (BCP) as part of the baseline recipe. Each cavity received an addition ~100 µm of chemical removal along with a second annealing treatment before the radial tuning process. Detailed information about the accuracy and homogeneity of LCLS-II cavities rolling is presented as well as results of field distribution analysis for TM011 zero-mode with a comparison to standard cavities.

Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities. These results could lead to a cost-effective path for improving the quality factor of cavities installed in CEBAF and ultimately saving accelerator operation cost. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP053 paper received ※ 24 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 29 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using How Is Flux Expulsion Affected by Geometry: Experimental Evidence and Model Measurements of magnetic sensitivity to trapped flux on several type of cavity geometries have been performed at IPNO showing a clear geometrical effect.

We have earlier reported on a VEP parameter study for 1.3 GHz single and nine-cell Nb cavities. The optimized VEP parameters and a unique rotating cathode yielded uniform removal and a smooth surface in the single cell cavity. The unique cathode and a dual flow mechanism for acid circulation were applied to improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. The vertically electropolished single and nine cell cavities achieved the same RF performance as achieved after the HEP processes. We are making efforts to further improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. Here",

The cavities have a reduced frequency due to additional material removal during cavity treatment well beyond the baseline recipe. The mechanical condition of the cavities was relatively soft because of the thermal history and the niobium manufacture requirement of an optimal flux expulsion. The niobium was highly recrystallized by 3 hours annealing at 900°C and 975°C respectively. Each cavity received an inner surface treatment of 200 µm electro-polishing (EP) and an external 30 µm buffered chemical polishing (BCP) as part of the baseline recipe. Each cavity received an addition ~100 µm of chemical removal along with a second annealing treatment before the radial tuning process.

and the search for optimal thermal gradient for reducing the trapped flux in cavities installed in CEBAF linacs. Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities. These results could lead to a cost-effective path for improving the quality factor of cavities installed in CEBAF and ultimately saving accelerator operation cost. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP053 paper received ※ 24 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 29 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using How Is Flux Expulsion Affected by Geometry: Experimental Evidence and Model Measurements of magnetic sensitivity to trapped flux on several type of cavity geometries have been performed at IPNO showing a clear geometrical effect.

Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons.

We have earlier reported on a VEP parameter study for 1.3 GHz single and nine-cell Nb cavities. The optimized VEP parameters and a unique rotating cathode yielded uniform removal and a smooth surface in the single cell cavity. The unique cathode and a dual flow mechanism for acid circulation were applied to improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. The vertically electropolished single and nine cell cavities achieved the same RF performance as achieved after the HEP processes. We are making efforts to further improve the removal uniformity in the nine-cell cavity. Here",
        "we report on a VEP of the 1.3 GHz Nb nine-cell cavity at a higher cathode rotation speed of 50 rpm. The VEP results reveal that the speed could be considered for improving the uniformity in removal while maintaining the surface smoothness. Required improvements in the VEP facility and acid flow condition for achieving uniform EP and a smooth surface are also described.",

Radial deformation of cavity cells can be provided by a special chain or a rolling device with three rollers. The chain distributes the radial forces on the equator area around the cell. The rollers are moving radially in relation to the rotating cavity and provide an equator diameter reduction. Both devices have the contour close to the cell shape at the equator area.

The cavities have a reduced frequency due to additional material removal during cavity treatment well beyond the baseline recipe. The mechanical condition of the cavities was relatively soft because of the thermal history and the niobium manufacture requirement of an optimal flux expulsion. The niobium was highly recrystallized by 3 hours annealing at 900°C and 975°C respectively. Each cavity received an inner surface treatment of 200 µm electro-polishing (EP) and an external 30 µm buffered chemical polishing (BCP) as part of the baseline recipe. Each cavity received an addition ~100 µm of chemical removal along with a second annealing treatment before the radial tuning process. Detailed information about the accuracy and homogeneity of LCLS-II cavities rolling is presented as well as results of field distribution analysis for TM011 zero-mode with a comparison to standard cavities.

Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons.

The cavities have a reduced frequency due to additional material removal during cavity treatment well beyond the baseline recipe. The mechanical condition of the cavities was relatively soft because of the thermal history and the niobium manufacture requirement of an optimal flux expulsion. The niobium was highly recrystallized by 3 hours annealing at 900°C and 975°C respectively. Each cavity received an inner surface treatment of 200 µm electro-polishing (EP) and an external 30 µm buffered chemical polishing (BCP) as part of the baseline recipe. Each cavity received an addition ~100 µm of chemical removal along with a second annealing treatment before the radial tuning process. Detailed information about the accuracy and homogeneity of LCLS-II cavities rolling is presented as well as results of field distribution analysis for TM011 zero-mode with a comparison to standard cavities.

Gradient for Flux Expulsion in 600°C Heat-treated CEBAF 12 GeV Upgrade Cavities We will present results on measurement of flux expulsion in CEBAF 12 GeV upgrade cavities and original CEBAF cavities and the search for optimal thermal gradient for reducing the trapped flux in cavities installed in CEBAF linacs. Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities. These results could lead to a cost-effective path for improving the quality factor of cavities installed in CEBAF and ultimately saving accelerator operation cost. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP053 paper received ※ 24 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 29 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using How Is Flux Expulsion Affected by Geometry: Experimental Evidence and Model Measurements of magnetic sensitivity to trapped flux on several type of cavity geometries have been performed at IPNO showing a clear geometrical effect.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons.

        "Radial tuning devices at DESY can be applied to any TESLA shape 1.3 GHz cavity to reduce its elongation due to excessive additional material removal (>300 µm) or to compensate critical manufacturing uncertainties. Radial deformation of cavity cells can be provided by a special chain or a rolling device with three rollers. The chain distributes the radial forces on the equator area around the cell. The rollers are moving radially in relation to the rotating cavity and provide an equator diameter reduction. Both devices have the contour close to the cell shape at the equator area. The required equator radius deviation depends on the tuning target and usually varies between (0.02…0.60) mm. Different aspects of the tuning procedure and material properties are described using the example of cavity rolling.",

      "abstract": "Radial tuning (rolling) was applied to three LCLS-II cavities to prevent that their lengths exceed the technical limits. The cavities have a reduced frequency due to additional material removal during cavity treatment well beyond the baseline recipe. The mechanical condition of the cavities was relatively soft because of the thermal history and the niobium manufacture requirement of an optimal flux expulsion. The niobium was highly recrystallized by 3 hours annealing at 900°C and 975°C respectively. Each cavity received an inner surface treatment of 200 µm electro-polishing (EP) and an external 30 µm buffered chemical polishing (BCP) as part of the baseline recipe. Each cavity received an addition ~100 µm of chemical removal along with a second annealing treatment before the radial tuning process. Detailed information about the accuracy and homogeneity of LCLS-II cavities rolling is presented as well as results of field distribution analysis for TM011 zero-mode with a comparison to standard cavities.

Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities. These results could lead to a cost-effective path for improving the quality factor of cavities installed in CEBAF and ultimately saving accelerator operation cost. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP053 paper received ※ 24 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 29 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using How Is Flux Expulsion Affected by Geometry: Experimental Evidence and Model Measurements of magnetic sensitivity to trapped flux on several type of cavity geometries have been performed at IPNO showing a clear geometrical effect.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons.

In order to ensure the new TD material performed equivalent to the niobium produced 4 year before after 900°C annealing; each heat lot of niobium had its flux expulsion characteristics parametrized and custom thermal treatments developed for each lot. Subsequent pure heat lot 9 cell cavities were made and tested. We will look at the flux expulsion characteristics of each lot",

The rollers are moving radially in relation to the rotating cavity and provide an equator diameter reduction. Both devices have the contour close to the cell shape at the equator area.

Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons.

Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization.

measurement of flux expulsion in CEBAF 12 GeV upgrade cavities and original CEBAF cavities and the search for optimal thermal gradient for reducing the trapped flux in cavities installed in CEBAF linacs. Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities. These results could lead to a cost-effective path for improving the quality factor of cavities installed in CEBAF and ultimately saving accelerator operation cost. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP053 paper received ※ 24 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 29 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using How Is Flux Expulsion Affected by Geometry: Experimental Evidence and Model Measurements of magnetic sensitivity to trapped flux on several type of cavity geometries have been performed at IPNO showing a clear geometrical effect.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons.

measurement of flux expulsion in CEBAF 12 GeV upgrade cavities and original CEBAF cavities and the search for optimal thermal gradient for reducing the trapped flux in cavities installed in CEBAF linacs. Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities. These results could lead to a cost-effective path for improving the quality factor of cavities installed in CEBAF and ultimately saving accelerator operation cost. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP053 paper received ※ 24 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 29 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using How Is Flux Expulsion Affected by Geometry: Experimental Evidence and Model Measurements of magnetic sensitivity to trapped flux on several type of cavity geometries have been performed at IPNO showing a clear geometrical effect.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons. A modified design of the pickup antenna have solved the PT pickup trip problem. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP064 paper received ※ 23 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 04 July 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using New Design of SSR2 Spoke Cavity for PIP II SRF Linac reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP066 paper received ※ 21 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 01 July 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using Plasma Processing to Reduce Field Emission in LCLS-II 1.3 GHz SRF Cavities",

        "the specific process parameters used to electropolish different superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavity geometries requires thoughtful attention. One seeks to realize confidently local diffusion-limited polishing at each point on the surface while maximizing uniformity of removal rate. Since the reaction rate is temperature dependent",
        "this implies that one must manage the cavity surface temperature during polishing. Too-high applied voltage aggravates temperature and thus removal non-uniformity",
        "but too-low applied voltage risks placing the large-diameter locations \"off the current plateau",
        "\" yielding etching rather than polishing. The majority of recent experience has been with elliptical L-band SRF cavities and some half-wave cavities at ANL. Lower frequency cavities with increased surface area and larger cathode-to-equator distance require fresh analysis and optimization. In preparation for SNS PPU project",

Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities. These results could lead to a cost-effective path for improving the quality factor of cavities installed in CEBAF and ultimately saving accelerator operation cost. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP053 paper received ※ 24 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 29 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using How Is Flux Expulsion Affected by Geometry: Experimental Evidence and Model Measurements of magnetic sensitivity to trapped flux on several type of cavity geometries have been performed at IPNO showing a clear geometrical effect.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons. A modified design of the pickup antenna have solved the PT pickup trip problem. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP064 paper received ※ 23 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 04 July 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using New Design of SSR2 Spoke Cavity for PIP II SRF Linac reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP066 paper received ※ 21 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 01 July 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using Plasma Processing to Reduce Field Emission in LCLS-II 1.3 GHz SRF Cavities",

Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities. These results could lead to a cost-effective path for improving the quality factor of cavities installed in CEBAF and ultimately saving accelerator operation cost. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP053 paper received ※ 24 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 29 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using How Is Flux Expulsion Affected by Geometry: Experimental Evidence and Model Measurements of magnetic sensitivity to trapped flux on several type of cavity geometries have been performed at IPNO showing a clear geometrical effect.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons. A modified design of the pickup antenna have solved the PT pickup trip problem. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP064 paper received ※ 23 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 04 July 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using New Design of SSR2 Spoke Cavity for PIP II SRF Linac reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP066 paper received ※ 21 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 01 July 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using Plasma Processing to Reduce Field Emission in LCLS-II 1.3 GHz SRF Cavities",

Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities. These results could lead to a cost-effective path for improving the quality factor of cavities installed in CEBAF and ultimately saving accelerator operation cost. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP053 paper received ※ 24 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 29 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using How Is Flux Expulsion Affected by Geometry: Experimental Evidence and Model Measurements of magnetic sensitivity to trapped flux on several type of cavity geometries have been performed at IPNO showing a clear geometrical effect.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons. A modified design of the pickup antenna have solved the PT pickup trip problem. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP064 paper received ※ 23 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 04 July 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using New Design of SSR2 Spoke Cavity for PIP II SRF Linac reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP066 paper received ※ 21 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 01 July 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using Plasma Processing to Reduce Field Emission in LCLS-II 1.3 GHz SRF Cavities",

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons.

This was done so that we could understand the shapes of the modes of the structure. These results were compared to impulse hammer testing from the outside of the cryomodule and to individual cavity frequency shifts when the cryomodule was cold. The prototype cryomodule had excessive microphonics of 150 Hz peak due to a thermos-acoustic oscillation. Design modifications were implemented and subsequently the cryomodules had microphonics on the order of 10 to 20 Hz. Results of the modal analysis as well as the background microphonics observed when operated under various cryogenic conditions and with different modifications will be presented.",

Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons.

Several models and experimental studies have been proposed and performed over the years to understand the origin of these anomalous losses but a general consensus on what these orgins are is yet to be established. In this contribution",
        "we present the results from the RF tests of several 1.3 GHz single-cell cavities limited by the HFQS and tested using a variable input coupler. This allowed to maintain close to critical coupling even at high field and the data showed that the HFQS did not saturate and that in some cases a power dissipation of up to 200 W at 2 K could be sustained without quench.",

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization.

Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons.

Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities. These results could lead to a cost-effective path for improving the quality factor of cavities installed in CEBAF and ultimately saving accelerator operation cost. reference for this paper ※ https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-SRF2019-TUP053 paper received ※ 24 June 2019       paper accepted ※ 29 June 2019        issue date ※ 14 August 2019 reference for this paper using How Is Flux Expulsion Affected by Geometry: Experimental Evidence and Model Measurements of magnetic sensitivity to trapped flux on several type of cavity geometries have been performed at IPNO showing a clear geometrical effect.

Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization.

Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities.

Preliminary measurements of one C100 cavities has shown that a nearly perfect flux expulsion can be achieved at an optimal thermal gradient - a surprising result contrary to the expectation of zero flux expulsion for 600°C heat treated niobium cavities.

It is one of the main limitations in current day superconducting cavities and couplers. The PT signal trip caused by discharge on the surface of RF ceramic window lead LLRF control system trip which affect the stable operation of the superconducting linac. Simulation of field emission electron trajectory in superconducting cavity and experimental measurements of the frequency of the pickup signal trip have been performed. A lot of aged window with characteristics of flashover were studied by means of material characterization. The flashover on the surface of RF ceramic window caused by electrons and field emission provide the origin of initial electrons.

Choked test cavities operating at 7.8 GHz with three RF chokes have been designed and tested at DL in a LHe cryostat verifying that the system could perform as required. Having a sample and a cavity physically separate reduces the complexity involved in changing samples (major causes of low throughput rate and high running costs for other test cavities) and also allows direct measurement of the RF power dissipated in the sample via power calorimetry. However",

        "An ongoing programme of development superconducting thin film coating for SRF cavities requires a facility for a quick sample evaluation at the RF conditions. One of the key specifications is a simplicity of the testing procedure",
        "allowing an easy installation and quick turnover of the testing samples. Choked test cavities operating at 7.8 GHz with three RF chokes have been designed and tested at DL in a LHe cryostat verifying that the system could perform as required. Having a sample and a cavity physically separate reduces the complexity involved in changing samples (major causes of low throughput rate and high running costs for other test cavities) and also allows direct measurement of the RF power dissipated in the sample via power calorimetry. However",
        "changing a sample and preparation for a test requires about two-week effort per sample. In order to simplify the measurements and achieve a faster turnaround",
        "a new cryostat cooled with a closed-cycle refrigerator has been designed",
        "built and tested. Changing a sample",
        "cooling down and testing can be reduced to 2-3 days per sample. Detailed design and results of testing of this facility will be reported at the conference.",

Most important in fabricating Nb3Sn thin films is the stoichiometry of the material produced",

        "S-I-S (superconductor-insulator-superconductor) multilayered structure has been proposed in order to increase the maximum acceleration gradient of SRF cavities. Nb3Sn is the material most expected as a superconducting layer of the S-I-S multilayered structure because it offers both a large critical temperature and large predicted Hsh. Most important in fabricating Nb3Sn thin films is the stoichiometry of the material produced",
        "and the lack of tin leads to performance degradation. We have launched a new in-house DC magnetron sputtering apparatus for Nb3Sn deposition. Nb and Sn layers were alternately and repeatedly deposited on Si wafer while adjusting the film thickness of each layer",
        "so we successfully obtained Nb-Sn films having appropriate composition ratio. The as-deposited films were annealed under the temperature of 600 degree C for 1 hour to generate the Nb3Sn phase. The characteristics of Nb-Sn films evaluated by XRD",

A total of 35 cryomodules will be fabricated at Jefferson Lab (JLab) in Virginia and Fermi National Laboratory (FNAL) in Illinois and transported via road to SLAC. A shipping frame with an inner bed isolated by springs was designed to protect the CMs from shocks and vibrations during shipments. Successful road testing of the JLab prototype paved the way for production CM shipments. The initial production shipments lead to several catastrophic failures in beamline vacuum in the cryomodules. The failures were determined to be due to fatigue in Fundamental Power Coupler (FPC) bellows due to excessive motion during shipment. A series of instrumented CM shipping tests and component tests were undertaken to develop a solution. A modified spring layout was tested and implemented",

The system will reduce the undesirable effects of Touschek scattering on the beam lifetime by providing bunch lengthening in the longitudinal direction by 2-4 times. The major technical components for the beam-driven 1.4 GHz fourth harmonic superconducting cryomodule are in hand and have been tested. These include a superconducting cavity",
