        "Over the past 30 years we have done about 6500 cold cavity tests on more than 800 different cavities at Jefferson Lab. Most of these tests were done with voltage controlled oscillator based phase locked loop systems. More recently we converted most of our systems to digital low level RF based systems. In addition to doing many of these test myself, I have been involved with the development, construction and commissioning of several cavity test systems and the software used to control them. My hope today is to provide you with a basic understanding of the RF systems necessary to perform these tests. I hope you leave here with an understanding of the importance of calibration processes and the control and understanding of potential error sources. I will also provide some information relating to the practical aspects of operating SRF cavities in real machines. Hopefully, A complete set of equations necessary for calculating the cavity parameters and can be found on the website for this conference as an addendum to this talk."
