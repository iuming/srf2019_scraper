        "RF-surface resistance measurements were performed with a Quadrupole Resonator (QPR) and an S-I-S’ sample (75 nm NbTiN on 15 nm AlN insulator on bulk Nb) prepared at JLab. Measurements were performed at 414",
        "845",
        "and 1286 MHz at sample temperatures from 2 K up to well above the transition temperature of NbTiN of ~17.3 K. The Rs exhibits an unexpected temperature dependence: Rather than rising monotonically",
        "as expected from BCS theory",
        "a local maximum is observed. There is a temperature range where Rs decreases with increasing temperature. Such behavior indicates that an additional interaction between the superconducting layers may have to be included in the surface resistance model. Measurements of the baseline Nb sample prior to coating exhibited no such behavior; hence systematic measurement errors can be excluded as the explanation. The maximum field was limited by a hard magnetic quench near 20 mT",
        "close to Hc1 of NbTiN",
        "suggesting that the sample is limited by early flux penetration."

        "the principal parameter that limits the performance of the cavity is the critical magnetic field or effective Hc1 at which vortices begin penetrating into the superconductor layer. This is predicted to depend on the combination of the film thickness. We made samples that have a NbN/SiO2 thin-film structure on a pure Nb substrate with several layers of NbN film deposited using DC magnetron sputtering method. Here",

It is shown that the interplay of the broadening of the quasiparticle density of states (DOS) peaks and a decrease of a quasiparticle gap caused by the RF currents produces a minimum in Rs(H0) and an extended rise of the quality factor Q(H0) with the RF field. Paramagnetic impurities shift the minimum in Rs(H0) to lower fields and can reduce Rs(H0) in a wide range of H0. Subgap states in the DOS can give rise to a residual surface resistance while reducing Rs at higher temperatures. A proximity-coupled normal layer can shift the minimum to either low and high fields and can reduce Rs below that of an ideal surface. The field dependence of Q(H0) can be very sensitive to the materials processing. The nonlinear RF losses can be minimized by tuning pairbreaking effects using impurity management or surface nanostructuring."

Few micron thick films with excellent structural and morphological properties are prepared via DC magnetron sputtering of stoichiometric targets. While DC superconducting properties were measured along with the optimization of the coating methods",

The sensitivity of Rs to thermal cycling around Tc",
