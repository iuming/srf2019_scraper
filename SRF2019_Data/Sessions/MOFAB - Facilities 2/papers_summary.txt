   Title: MESA: The Mainz Energy Recovering Superconducting Accelerator
   Authors: F. Hug, D. Simon, T. Stenglerpresenter, C.P. Stoll, S.D.W. Thomas, KPH, Mainz, Germany, HIM, Mainz, Germany
   Institutions: The Mainz Energy-Recovering Superconducting Accelerator (MESA) is currently under construction at Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz. It is a mulit-turn ERL for particle and nuclear physics experiments. As the centerpiece for acceleration a turn-key solution was chosen. Two modified ELBE/Rossendorf-type cryomodules will accelerate the electrons up to 25 MeV per turn. The modules will be operated in cw at an accelerating gradient of 12.5 MV/m. The modifications comprise of an integration of a piezo tuner system and a better thermal connection of the HOM antennas for allowing high beam current in cw operation. Site acceptance tests of both modules have been carried out at the Helmholtz Institute Mainz (HIM) and by now the first cryomodule was successfully operated at design gradient and could be accepted. This talk will cover the experiences with a turn-key solution made by industry and will show the results of the site acceptance tests.

   Title: SRF Status of the RAON Heavy Ion Accelerator Project
   Authors: H.C. Jung, H. Jang, Y. Kim, Y.K. Kwon, IBS, Daejeon, Republic of Korea, Quarter-wave resonators (QWR), Half-wave resonators (HWR)are adopted for the low energy superconducting linear accelerator of RAON, two types Single spoke resonators(SSR type1, SSR type2) are for the High energy. The performance tests for the prototypes of QWR, HWR cryomodules are carried and the designed goals are achieved. About 130 QWR/HWR cavities and 56 modules shall be produced and tested within 2020. For the cryogenic tests, facilities are constructed with 5 module-test bunkers and 5 cavity-test pits. First one cryomodule with 3 SSR1 cavities will be tested in this year and two cryomodules with 6 SSR2 cavities will be tested within the first quarter of the next year.

   Title: Overview and SRF Requirements of the CiADS Project
   Authors: Y. He, Q. Chen, Z. Gao, H. Guo, G. Huang, Y.L. Huang, T.C. Jiang, C.L. Li, S.H. Liu, T. Tan, Y.Q. Wan, F.F. Wang, J.Q. Wu, W.M. Yue, B. Zhang, J.H. Zhang, S.H. Zhang, S.X. Zhang, IMP/CAS, Lanzhou, People’s Republic of China, J.P. Dai, F.S. He, Z.Q. Li, W.M. Pan, IHEP, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, People’s Republic of China, Chinese initiative Accelerator Driven System started constructing in 2018. It consists a superconducting linac with 500 MeV and 5 mA; an LEB coolant fast reactor with 7.5 MW. The first beam coupling with reactor will be in 2024. The sc linac employed 5 families of superconducting resonators, two types of HWRs (β=0.1 and β=0.19), one type of double spokes (β=0.42) and two types of ellipticals (β=0.62 and β=0.82). The whole system will operate in 2 K. A space has been reserved for future upgrading to 1 GeV. As a demo of front-end of ADS, the CAFe (China ADS Front-end demo linac) has been developed and commissioned to verify the SRF techniques, high power CW beam and RAMI. 45 kW proton beam has been delivered to the dump and lasted more than 100 hours at the beginning of 2019. According to the operation experience, the challenge is the stability and performance of cavities under the heavy beam loading, some phenomenas have been observed. Up to now, the design of bulk Nb cavities have been finished and the prototype fabrication is on going. The techniques of Nb/Cu cavity and Nb3Sn are also developed in IMP for the future project of ADS.

   Title: Status and Challenges of the MYRRHA SRF Linac
   Authors: SCK•CEN, Mol, Belgium, The MYRRHA project aims at realizing a demonstrator Accelerator Driven System (ADS), of which the essential goal is to provide an optimized path towards transmutation. This allows to greatly reduce the burden of long lived nuclear waste originating from fission power plants. The specific ADS application requires a CW driver linac with an exceptionally high beam-MTBF of 250 hours, a beam failure corresponding to a beam trip longer than 3 s. The key feature for obtaining this level of reliability is fault tolerance. It is essentially provided through the serial redundancy that the highly modular structure of the superconducting linac combined with adequate operational margins offers. Phase 1 of MYRRHA will see the construction of the 100 MeV linac based on one family of β=0.37 superconducting 2-gap spoke cavities. The evaluation of the fault tolerance mechanism will be a major topic of this linac’s exploitation.

   Title: More than 15 Years of CW SRF Operation at ELBE
   Authors: A. Arnold, M. Freitag, U. Lehnert, P. Michel, P. Murcek, Ch. Schneider, J. Teichert, R. Xiang, HZDR, Dresden, Germany, ELBE is a compact, accelerator-driven photon and particle source. Since 2001 it is operated as a user facility, providing more than 5500 hours of beam time each year. The electron accelerator is based on four superconducting 9-cell TESLA cavities that are driven in full CW operation to accelerate an average current of 1 mA up to beam energies of 40 MeV. The first part of the talk will summarize our experiences of operating TESLA cavities in CW. In detail, this includes their performance and attempts to improve it, as well as investigations on limitations. Additionally, we will discuss several issues that are related to the high average RF as well as beam power and we will present appropriate measures to protect the machine. In this regard, a resonant ring for RF component tests up to 100 kW was set up. The second part of the talk will focus on the development and operation of our SRF guns that are designed to produce short bunches with high charges and repetition rates of 1 MHz and beyond. Recently, SRF gun II was successfully transferred into routine user operation and delivers now more than 200 pC at 100 kHz to the experiment. First convincing results will be presented.
