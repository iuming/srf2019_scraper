Optimization of SRF cavities mainly focuses on pushing the limits of bulk Niobium, cost reduction of cavity fabrication and development of new SRF materials for future accelerators (ILC, FCC). Nowadays chemical etching is the only surface treatment used to prepare SRF surface made of Nb. However the operational cost of chemical facilities is high and these present a very bad ecological footprint. The search of an alternative technique could make the construction of these future large scale facilities possible. Metallographic polishing (MP) is a candidate not only for bulk Nb treatment, but could also provide the mirror-finished substrate for alternative SRF thin films deposition. Recent R&D studies, conducted at IPNO & IRFU, focused on the development of 2-steps MP procedure of Nb flat samples. Roughness of polished surface has been proven better than standard EP treatment and less polluted than CBP. MP provides on flat surfaces a high removal rate (above 1 µm/min) and high reproducibility. The paper will describe the optimized method and present all the surface analysis performed. The first RF characterization of a polished disk will be presented.

Surface measurement of superconducting samples is required to characterize processes of bulk niobium preparation for SRF resonators. In order to reduce characterization cost and improve measurement performances, a pill-box cavity has been developed at IPN Orsay. Using TE011 and TE012 modes, we describe the latest results based on calorimetric method.

Being able to obtain BCS and material properties from the same surface is necessary to gain a fundamental understanding of the evolution of SRF surfaces. A test resonator which will allow to obtain BCS properties from samples is currently under development at the University of Hamburg and DESY and is based on the Quadrupole Resonators developed and operated at CERN and HZB. The current status of the necessary infrastructure, the procurement process and design considerations are shown. In addition, an outline of the planed R&D project with the Quadrupole Resonator will be presented and first RF measurements and surface analysis results of samples will be shown

Smooth polycrystalline Nb metal foils were exposed to dilute N2 and Kr atmospheres at elevated temperatures of up to 900°C. Transmission mode X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS) experiments were used to study the resulting changes of the atomic short range order structure in-situ. EXAFS data were collected prior to any heat treatment as well as during the different process steps at elevated temperatures with a time resolution of about 1 s, and the samples were also studied after cooling to room temperature. In general, only very small changes of the Nb-EXAFS data could be detected after the processing in N2-atmospheres, and no evidence for bulk formation of Nb-nitrides was found. In contrast, the quantitative EXAFS data evaluation revealed slightly distorted Nb-Nb coordinations, suggesting that N-atoms are increasingly incorporated on octahedral interstitial sites in the host lattice with increasing N2-exposure. For the treatments in Kr-atmospheres, simultaneous measurements are feasible at both the K-edge of the Nb host and the Kr dopant. Those studies gave clear evidence for a Kr uptake during the heat treatment, and will be discussed in more detail at the conference.

Our work is mainly focused on the deposition methods of Nb3Sn films on Cu substrates and film‘s properties. The superconducting transition temperature(Tc) of Nb3Sn film is 12K. There are diffraction peaks of Nb3Sn in the X-ray diffraction patterns in which without diffraction peaks of copper compounds. Scanning electron micro-structures of Nb3Sn film reflect its nice compactness and binding force between film and substrate.

Thin film cavities were proposed as the most promis-ing next generation superconducting cavities. The chal-lenges are improving the surface superconducting per-formance and reducing defects of the coating film, which can be greatly solved by laser annealing. Laser annealing system has been set up in Peking University, and experi-ments with niobium thin film sample have been carried out. Superconducting performance and other properties of Nb/Cu samples before and after annealing were com-pared. Recrystallization happened and surface structure improved a lot according to the results.

The mechanism of electropolishing of niobium (Nb) from choline chloride-based deep eutectic solvent (DES) was studied by anodic polarization tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using a Nb rotating disk electrode (RDE). Based on the results of an anodic polarisation test, the electropolishing of Nb is mass transport controlled. EIS results are consistent with the compact salt film mechanism for niobium electropolishing in this electrolyte. The influence of rotation rate, applied potential and electrolyte temperature on the electropolishing mechanism of Nb was investigated. As the applied potential positively shift, Rct, Rp and L increase, CPE decrease and Rs unchanged. The increase in rotation rate and electrolyte temperature leads to a decrease of Rs, Rct, Rp and L, and an increase of CPE.

The melting regimes of the niobium ingots with high chemical purity and low hardness for the Nb3Sn, NbTi and other superconducting materials manufacture have been developed at SC "VNIINM". Using this niobium material and by the SC "VNIINM" manufacture regimes at the SC "Chepetsky Mechanical Plant" 220 tons of Nb3Sn and NbTi strands for ITER and 12 km of Nb3Sn strands for HL-LHC (CERN) with the required characteristics have been successfully produced. The review of the characteristics of the different semiproducts (sheets, tubes, rods), made in Russia from the special grade niobium, and of the superconducting strands, manufactured with the use of them, is presented in the paper. The ways of the further improvement of the niobium ingots melting regimes and niobium sheets deformation and annealing regimes with the target of achieving RRR > 300 for the SRF cavities application are discussed.

The High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) is the upgrade of the world’s largest particle collider; it will allow the full exploitation of the LHC potential and its operation beyond 2025. An essential part of the HL-LHC project are the Crab Cavities, that are particle deflecting SRF cavities of non-axisymmetric shape made of bulk ultra-high purity Nb. Since the cavities are produced by complex metal sheet forming processes, followed by a heat treatment (HT) for H outgassing (650 °C, 24 h), there is uncertainty on their mechanical properties after manufacturing and in service conditions (2 K). Mechanical tests at room temperature have been conducted on RRR300 pure Nb samples. The samples were previously submitted, by cold cross-rolling, to different levels of plastic deformation representative of the effective plastic strain seen by the Nb sheets during forming operations. Moreover, a comparison of the mechanical properties of cold cross-rolled samples before and after HT has been established. Results of evolution of the microstructure and hardness are also presented. This study can be of interest for Nb cavities to be sub-mitted to HT at 650 °C, and may help to push the design of novel SRF cavities.

Small amounts of interstitial impurities in the penetra-tion depth of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities have a dramatic effect on the quality factors and maximum accelerating gradients. Here we report the first TOF-SIMS studies of cutouts from cavities prepared by all modern surface treatments, which allow a direct corre-lation of the impurity distribution with the observed cavity performance. Imaging capability of our instrument allows to avoid the possible issues associated with the ‘‘ghost’’ depth profiles appearing as a consequence of particulate surface contamination, which likely caused the inconclusive SIMS results on e.g. oxygen diffusion in the past.

Historically, niobium has been used as the superconducting material in SRF cavities. Due the high operational costs, other materials are currently being considered. Nb3Sn coatings have been investigated over the past several decades, motivated by potentially higher operating temperatures. More recently niobium has been doped with nitrogen to improve the quality factor (Q). Currently, a need for better understanding still exists for both mechanisms. EBSD has been shown to be a viable technique to determine the crystallographic orientation and the size of the Nb3Sn grains. The EBSD maps obtained show a bimodal distribution of grain sizes with smaller Nb3Sn grains found present near the Nb3Sn/Nb interface. In addition to the Nb3Sn coatings, N-doped niobium coupons were analyzed by EBSD and found that the coupon had preferred surface orientation. The EBSD analysis was found to be vital as specific grains could be targeted in SIMS to better understand the diffusion of nitrogen with respect to crystal orientation.

Trapped micro-Tesla levels of magnetic flux degrade the performance of Nb superconducting radio frequency (SRF) accelerators. Recent studies have revisited the role of small deformation (dislocation substructure influence) on cavity performance. However, the link between microstructural defects and mechanisms leading to poor performance is still unresolved. To examine the mechanism of flux pinning by dislocations and grain boundaries, systematic studies on bi-crystal Nb tensile samples were designed with strategically chosen orientation relationships between neighboring crystals with respect to the grain boundaries. Laue X-ray diffraction and electron backscatter diffraction analysis was used to measure crystal orientations of a large-grain Nb slice, from which the bi-crystals were extracted. Dislocation structures near the grain boundaries were characterized before and after 5% tensile deformation using electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI), after which the magnetic flux behavior was observed using cryogenic magneto-optical imaging (MOI). We discuss the conditions under which we observe increased flux pinning in regions of high dislocation density.

The Cornell BNL ERL Test Accelerator (CBETA) employs a superconducting Main Linac Cryomodule in order to perform multi-turn energy recovery operation. Optimizing the field stability of the low bandwidth SRF cavities in the presence of microphonics with limited available RF power is a challenging task. Despite of this, the Main Linac Cryomodule has been successfully used in CBETA to impart a maximum energy gain of 54 MeV, well above the energy gain requirement of CBETA. In this paper, we present an overview of our RF commissioning procedure including automatic coarse tuning, measurement of DAC and phase offsets. We further detail our microphonics measurements from our most recent run period.

Diamond Light Source has been providing beam for users since January 2007. The electron beam in the storage ring is normally driven by two superconducting CESR-B cavities, with two similar cavities available as spares. Day-to-day reliability of the cavities, measured by storage ring MTBF, has improved enormously over the years. A full analysis of how this improvement has been achieved is given, with particular attention paid to cavity voltage and vacuum pressure management, and the scheduling and procedure of cavity conditioning. The benefits and risks of full and partial warm-ups of the cavities are discussed, and details and impacts of cavity failure and repair are presented.

The Early Injector Commissioning program for LCLS-II aims to demonstrate CW electron beam production this year in the first two meters of the injector that includes the room-temperature 185.7 MHz single-cell gun and the 1.3 GHz two-cell buncher cavity. These cavities were designed and built by LBNL based on their experience with similar ones for their Advanced Photo-Injector Experiment (APEX) program. With the 258 nm laser system and Cs2Te cathodes, bunches of up to 300 pC are expected at rates as high as 1 MHz. The paper presents results from this program including the vacuum levels achieved, RF processing and field control experience, dark current measurements and laser and beam characterization.

An innovative vertical cryostat has been developed and commissioned at STFC Daresbury Laboratory for qualifying the high-beta SRF cavities for the ESS (European Spallation Source). The cryostat is designed to test 3 dressed cavities in horizontal configuration in one cold run at 2K. The cavities are cooled to 2K with superfluid liquid helium filled into individual helium jackets of the cavities. This reduces the liquid helium consumption by more than 70% in comparison with the conventional vertical tests. The paper describes the cryogenic system and its performance with detail discussions on the initial results.

The Turkish Accelerator and Radiation Laboratory (TARLA) is proposed as an accelerator-based radiation source facility to provide a research instrument for researchers from both Turkey and region. The facility is located at the Ankara University Institute of Accelerator Technologies and proposed as the first accelerator based research infrastructure in Turkey. The superconducting accelerator of TARLA is currently under commissioning and will drive two Free Electron Laser (FEL) lines in the mid- and far-infrared ranges and a high flux Bremsstrahlung radiation to 40 MeV electron beam in Continuous Wave (CW) mode. The SRF cryomodules have been delivered by industry in 2017. In this paper, we present the achieved vertical test results of the SRF cavities, the results of the high power RF test of the fundamental power couplers and the first test results of the integrated piezo tuner. After the successful commissioning of the cryogenic plant operating at 1.8 K with ±0.2 mbar pressure stability, the commissioning of the SRF cryomodules is now ongoing and the current status and results achieved so far are explained.

Accelerator-based light sources, in particular, those based on linear accelerators, are intrinsically less stable than lasers or other more conventional light sources because of their large scale. In order to achieve optimal data quality, the properties of each light pulse need to be detected and implemented into the analysis of each experiment. Such schemes are of particular advantage in 4th generation light sources based on superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) technology, since here the combination of pulse-resolved detection schemes with high-repetition-rate is particularly fruitful. Implementation of several different purpose-built CMOS linear array detector will enable to perform arrival-time measurements at MHz repetition rates. An architecture based on FPGA technology will allow an online analysis of the measured data at MHz repetition rate and will decrease the amount of data throughput and disk capacity for storing the data by orders of magnitude. In this contribution, we will outline how the pulse-resolved data acquisition scheme of the TELBE user facility shall be upgraded to allow operation at MHz repetition rates and sub-femtosecond timing precision.

The LHC accelerating RF system consists of two cryomodules per beam, each containing four single-cell niobium sputtered 400.8 MHz superconducting cavities working at 4.5 K and an average accelerating voltage of 2 MV. The paper summarises the experience, availability and evolution of the system within 10 years of operation. The lessons learned from the successful replacement and re-commissioning of one cryomodule with a spare module, and the recent re-test of the originally installed module on the test stand are also included. Finally, a review of currently launched spare cavity production and long-term developments are presented.

The first all-SRF accelerator driven THz source has been operated as a user facility since 2018 at ELBE radiation center. The CW electron beam is extracted from SRF gun II, accelerated to relativistic energies and compressed to sub-ps length in the ELBE SRF linac with a chicane. THz pulses are produced by pass-ing the short electron bunches through a diffraction radiator (CDR) and an undulator. The coherent THz power increases quadratically with bunch charge. The pulse energy up to 10 µJ at 0.3 THz with 100 kHz has been generated.

The construction of the first phase of the MYRRHA project (MINERVA: 100 MeV-4 mA proton Linac) was recently decided by the Belgium Government. In the long term, the MYRRHA project plans to construct an ADS demonstrator for the transmutation of long-lived radioactive waste. It will include a subcritical reactor of 100 MW thermal power and a CW proton Linac accelerator (600 MeV-4 mA). The main challenge of this Linac is an extremely high reliability performance to limit stresses and long restart procedures of the reactor. The MINERVA Linac includes 30 cryomodules housing 60 Single-Spoke SC cavities. A cryomodule prototype with its valve box is under construction at IPNO institute. The cavities operate at 352 MHz in a superfluid Helium bath at 2K. Therefore, a reliable SC Linac Cryogenic System is essential. This article presents the preliminary studies in this subject including the analysis of high thermal loads induced by the CW mode operation of cavities (950 W@2 K per cryomodule). A Cryogenic Refrigerator with an equivalent power capacity of 2645 W @4.5 K (3970 W with 1.5 overcapacity factor) is proposed. The constrains for the He distribution in the Linac tunnel are also discussed.

A new vertical cryostat, called Gersemi, installed at FREIA Laboratory at Uppsala University, Sweden, is designed to test superconducting magnets and radio-frequency cavities and operates at temperatures between 1.8 K and 4.2 K. Two different inserts can be used to test different superconducting equipment: a helium saturated bath insert for cavities without a helium vessel and a λ-plate insert for magnet testing in superfluid helium pressurized bath. The cold vessel cryostat has an internal diameter of 1.1 m and a useful height of 3.5 m. A valve box supplies the cryostat with the cryogens (LN2, LHe, SHe) and is linked to a gas reheater. The last one is connected to a helium recovery circuit and to a helium pumping system (4.5 g/s at 16 mbar). The Gersemi vertical cryostat is a part of FREIA cryogenic facility which also contains a helium liquefier and a horizontal cryostat inside of a bunker allowing the test of superconducting cavity cryomodules. The first results of the cryogenic tests on this equipment are reported.

A cryomodule with two Double-Quarter Wave (DQW) cavities was designed, built and tested with the SPS beam in 2018. Each cavity was equipped with an rf pickup antenna to monitor field amplitude and phase. The pickup antenna also included a section expressly designed to couple and extract one of the Higher-Order Modes (HOM) at 1.754 GHz. The SPS beam tests evidenced direct coupling of the beam to this pickup antenna, in a similar way that a beam position monitor pickup couples to the passing beam. This undesired coupling had an impact on the RF feedback system responsible to regulate the cavity field and frequency. The present paper proposes a new DQW cavity design with improved antennae which provides adequate fundamental mode extraction while providing a reduction of both direct coupling to the beam and heat dissipation.

One of the key devices of the HL-LHC project are SRF crab cavities. A cryomodule with two Double Quarter Wave (DQW) crab cavities has been successfully fabricat-ed and tested with beam at CERN whereas the Radio Frequency Dipole (RFD) crab cavities are currently on its fabrication process. The paper provides an insight on the multiple calculations carried out to evaluate the thermal and mechanical performance of the DQW and RFD cavi-ties and its components. In some cases, the presence of RF fields inside the cavity volume requires the use of mul-tiphysics numerical models capable of coupling these fields with the thermal and mechanical domains. In fact, the RF field presents a strong dependency on the cavity shape, whereas the mechanical, thermal and electrical properties of the materials may substantially vary as a function of temperature, which in turn depends on the RF field. The results presented in this paper, using both cou-pled and uncoupled models, allowed elucidating the importance of physics coupling on the numerical evalua-tion of RF cavities and its components. Analyses were also of great support for the design evaluation and im-provement of future prototypes.

Nowadays, one of the main issues of the superconducting thin film resonant cavities is the Cu surface preparation. A better understanding of the impact of copper surface preparation on the morphological, superconductive (SC) and RF properties of the coating, is mandatory in order to improve the performances of superconducting cavities by coating techniques. ARIES H2020 collaboration includes a specific work package (WP15) to study the influence of Cu surface polishing on the SRF performances of Nb coatings that involves a team of 8 research groups from 7 different countries. In the present work, a comparison of 4 different polishing processes for Cu (Tumbling, EP, SUBU, EP+SUBU) is presented through the evaluation of the SC and morphological properties of Nb thin film coated on Cu planar samples and QPR samples, polished with different procedures. Effects of laser annealing on Nb thin films have also been studied. Different surface characterizations have been applied: roughness measurements, SEM, EDS, XRD, AFM, and thermal and photo-stimulated exoelectrons measurements. SC properties were evaluated with PPMS, and QPR measurements will be carry out at HZB in the beginning of 2019.

As part of efforts to improve the performance of thin film coated accelerating cavities, improvement of the topography of the surface of copper is being pursued. This is known to strongly affect the properties of the deposited superconducting thin film. This study focuses on determining the optimal procedure to enhance homogeneity and smoothness of the copper surface. OFHC copper substrates have been processed using mechanical polishing (MP), chemical polishing (CP) and electropolishing (EP) procedures as well as a combina-tion thereof. The parameters of each of the procedures have been tested and optimised to produce the smoothest surface possible. The resulting samples have been analysed using a scanning electron microscope, a laser profilometer and a confocal microscope. Results indicate the superior per-formance of electrochemical polishing over chemical polishing in terms of planarization efficiency, while a combination of mechanical polishing followed by electropolishing provides the most homogeneous and smooth surface when utilising the critical current density of the electrolyte.

As part of efforts to improve the performance of SRF cavities, to that prescribed by future operating requirements, alternative materials are currently being investigated. NbN is one of the alternatives under investigation to provide these better performance figures. In this contribution, a summary of results from an investigation into DC magnetron sputtered NbN thin films deposited onto copper substrates is presented. The copper substrates were prepared using a mechanical polishing process, followed by a chemical etching process. The NbN films were prepared in a large scale commercial coating system. A high and low value for the substrate temperature, process pressure, bias voltage, cathode power, nitrogen gas percentage, and the working gas type, using either Argon or Krypton, constitute the parameters of this study. The base pressure of the system prior to deposition was 5x107 hPa for all coatings. The resulting films have been characterised using various surface characterisation methods to determine the effects of the deposition parameters during the film growth process. The deposition parameters have been optimised based on the characterisation results.

Cutting edge SRF technology is likely approaching the fundamental limitations of niobium cavities operating in the Meissner state. This combined with the obvious advantages of using higher critical temperature superconductors and thin film depositions leads to interest in the RF characterization of such materials. A TE mode niobium sample host cavity was used to characterize the RF performance of 5" (12.7 cm) diameter sample plates as a function of field and temperature at 4 GHz. Materials studied include MgB2 and thin film atomic layer deposition (ALD) NbN and NbTiN on Nb substrates. These higher critical temperature superconductors all having coherence lengths on the order of a few nm. It is therefore likely that defects on the order of the coherence lengths will cause early flux penetration well before the theorized superheating field of an ideal superconducting surface. Superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) multilayers have been proposed as a mechanism of arresting these early penetration flux avalanches and are therefore studied here as well, using the same NbN and NbTiN films, but over thin layers of insulating AlN on Nb substrates.

RF characterization of arbitrary superconducting samples has been of interest for many years but, due to the experimental complexities, has never been achieved to its full potential. A TE mode niobium sample host cavity has been used at Cornell to characterize the RF performance of 5" (12.7 cm) diameter sample plates. It was designed and built in 2012 – 2013 and since then has encountered a range of problems. The focus of this work is to highlight these and to present solutions to assist future researchers hoping to design novel RF characterization instruments. Topics covered include coupler design, cryostat support structure, sample preparation, and a discussion of potential systematic errors introduced by the data extraction and calibration methods applied to this device.

Dissipation due to flux trapping is a persistent problem experienced in SRF cavity testing and cryomodule operation. This work addresses accurately and cheaply measuring magnetic fields in a cryostat without using delicate and expensive fluxgate magnetometers. Anisotropic Magnetoresistive (AMR) magnetic field sensors were investigated for the detection of small fields in a cryogenic environment. Initial development of instrumentation using 16 AMR sensors is presented for the purpose of measuring magnetic fields perpendicular the normal of a 5" diameter sample plate on the Cornell sample host cavity.

SRF cavities made with bulk Nb have been the backbone of high-power modern linear accelerators. Demands for higher energy and more efficient linear accelerators, however, have strained the capabilities of bulk Nb close to its fundamental limit. Several routes have been proposed using thin film novel superconductors (e.g. Nb3Sn), SIS multilayer, and N-doping. Beta-NMR techniques are more suitable for the characterization of Meissner state in these materials, due to the capability of soft-landing radioactive ions on the nanometer scale of London penetration depth, as compared to micrometer probe of the muSR technique. Upgrade of the existing beta-NQR beamline, combined with the capability of high parallel magnetic field (200 mT) are the scope of the beta-SRF facility which has been fully funded. All hardware required for the upgrade has also been procured. The status of the commissioning, which is currently in phase I, is reported here, together with the future schedule of phase II with the fully installed beta-SRF beamline. Finally, the detail layout of the completed beamline and sample requirements will be included in this paper which might be of interest of future users.

The maximum accelerating gradient of SRF cavities can be increased by raising the field of initial flux penetration, Hvp. Thin alternating layers of superconductors and insulators (SIS) can potentially increase Hvp. Magnetometry is commercially available but consists of limitations, such as SQUID measurements apply a field over both superconducting layers, so Hvp through the sample cannot be measured. If SIS structures are to be investigated a magnetic field must be applied locally, from one plane of the sample, with no magnetic field on the opposing side to allow Hvp to be measured. A magnetic field penetration experiment has been developed at Daresbury laboratory, where a VTI has been created for a cryostat where Hvp of a sample can be measured. The VTI has been designed to allow flat samples to be measured to reduce limitations such as edge effects by creating a DC magnetic field smaller than the sample. A small, parallel magnetic field is produced on the sample by the use of a ferrite yoke. The field is increased to determine Hvp by using 2 hall probes either side of the sample.

The JLab Low Energy Recirculating Facility, LERF, has been modified to support concurrent testing of two LCLS-II cryomodules. The cryomodules are installed in a similar fashion as they would be in the L1 section of the LCLS-II linac, including the floor slope and using all of the LCLS-II hardware and controls for cryomodule cryogenics, vacuum, and RF (SSA and LLRF). From the start, it was intended to use LCLS-II electronics and EPICS software controls for cryomodule testing. In affect the LERF test facility becomes the first opportunity to commission and operate the LCLS-II LINAC hardware and software controls. Support for specific cryomodule high level test applications like Q0 and HOMs measurements, are being developed from the basic cryomodule control suite. To support the testing, 2 K He is supplied from the CEBAF south linac cryogenic system, where care must be taken when using the LERF test facility to not upset the CEBAF cryogenics plant. This paper discusses the commissioning of the hardware and software development for testing the first two LCLS-II cryomodules.

The magnetic field at which first flux penetrates is a fundamental parameter characterizing superconducting materials for SRF cavities. Therefore, an accurate technique is needed to measure the penetration of the magnetic field directly. The conventional magnetometers are inconvenient for thin superconducting film measurements because these measurements are strongly influenced by orientation, edge and shape effects. In order to measure the onset of field penetration in bulk, thin films and multi-layered superconductors, we have designed, built and calibrated a system combining a small superconducting solenoid capable of generating surface magnetic field higher than 500 mT and Hall probe to detect the first entry of vortices. This setup can be used to study various promising alternative materials to Nb, especially SIS multilayer coatings on Nb that have been recently proposed to delay the vortex penetration in Nb surface. In this paper, the system will be described and calibration will be presented.

The cryogenic facilities for cryomodule testing at Jefferson Lab (JLab) have been modified and to enable testing of Linear Coherent Light Source-II (LCLS-II) cryomodules. Temporary changes in u-tube connections at the Cryogenic Test Facility (CTF) has enabled rates of cavity cooling that are a factor of 10 higher than previously achieved. Cryogenic connections at JLab¿s Low Energy Recirculator Facility (LERF) have been repurposed to enable two LCLS-II cryomodules to be tested in series. This testing shares the helium space with the Central Helium Liquefier (CHL) that is also used by the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF). Cryomodule testing can occur while beam operation is ongoing at CEBAF. Improvements to these facilities have allowed the testing of the JLab¿s highest ever performing cryomodules.

SRF Cavity and Cryomodule testing and production requires a consistent means of collecting and analyzing data against quality and production parameters. JLab’s engineering data management system, Pansophy, is utilized to assist project leaders and subject matter experts (SMEs) with such tasks, by providing a means to data mine key parameter indicators (KPI) and production planning and status data. Recent enhancements to reporting and trending have been utilized for the LCLS-II and CEBAF 12 GeV upgrade projects. Further enhancements are being planned for future projects, like SNS-PPU, such as KPI trending, KPI quality, vendor quality, production timelines and user defined queries. Being able to understand past trends will assist with enhancements to future projects.

Seebeck effect of metals play an important role in cryomodule design. As cryomodule cools down from room temperature down to nominal cavity operating temperature, components in a cryomodule experiences different temperatures. Some components such as power couplers cross from room temperature to 2 K. Thermo electric current forms loops circulating through and around cavities. Such current loops will generate additional magnetic field that could be trapped into cavity wall during superconducting transition as well as during cavity quench. These trapped field can degrade cavity quality factor and increase heat load. Simple circuit model is proposed and compared to calculated trapped field during cryomodule tests.

The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility is currently engaged, along with several other Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories, in the Linac Co-herent Light Source II project (LCLS-II). The SRF Insti-tute at Jefferson Lab is currently building 21 cryomod-ules for this project. The cryomodules are based on the XFEL design and have been modified for continuous wave (CW) operation and to comply with other LCLS-II specifications. Each cryomodule contains eight 9-cell cavities with coaxial power couplers operating at 1.3 GHz. The cryomodule also contain a magnet package that consists of a quadrupole and two correctors. Most of these cryomodules will be tested in the Cryomodule Test Facility (CMTF) at Jefferson Lab before shipment to SLAC. Up to three of these cryomodules will be tested in a test stand set up in the Low Energy Recovery Facility (LERF) at Jefferson Lab. Acceptance testing of the LCLS-II cryomodules began in December 2016. Twelve cryomodules have currently completed Acceptance Test-ing. This paper will summarize the results of those tests.

The prototype cryomodule for the ESS double spoke cavities is tested in the FREIA laboratory at Uppsala University. One of the goals of this test is to establish an efficient way to assess one series cryomodule within a due time (about one month). In 2017, the dedicated high-power test for dressed cavities in the horizontal cryostat (HNOSS) revealed that one of the possible challenges is a conditioning process of the coupler and cavity multipacting. Each process should not damage any components of the cryomodule but at the same time it should be finished in a reasonable time scale. More importantly, unlike the previous tests in the vertical or horizontal cryostat, conditioning two cavities in one cryomodule in due time may require parallel processing in some part of the procedure. This study will be the first practical experience of double spoke cavity conditioning in a cryomodule, and will lead to a standard conditioning recipe for future projects containing superconducting spoke cavities. In this presentation, a preliminary result of cryomodule testing will be shown with a special focus on the conditioning processes.

The main part of the SRF linac for the Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLS-II) at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory will consist of 35 cryomodules with superconducting RF cavities operating at 1.3 GHz. The cryomodules are assembled and tested at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. Following the transport to SLAC, the cryomodules undergo several incoming inspection steps before ultimately being moved to the tunnel for installation in the linac. The RF part of the incoming inspection covers measurements of a number of parameters like cavity frequency spectrum, notch filter frequency of the higher order mode couplers and external quality factor Qext of the input coupler. The inspection results are compared to measurements at the partner labs prior to shipping and the nominal values in order to verify that the cryomodules have not been damaged during the transport and are ready for installation. We present an overview and analysis of the inspections for the cryomodules received to date.

The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) is under construction at Michigan State University (MSU). The FRIB superconducting driver linac will accelerate ion beams to 200 MeV per nucleon. The driver linac requires 104 quarter-wave resonators (QWRs, β = 0.041 and 0.085) and 220 half-wave resonators (HWRs, β = 0.29 and 0.54). The jacketed resonators are Dewar tested at MSU before installation into cryomodules. The cryomodules for β = 0.041, 0.085, and 0.29 have been completed and certified; 88% of the β = 0.54 HWRs have been certified (as of March 2019). Beam commissioning of the QWR cryomodules is in progress. The Dewar certification tests have provided valuable statistics on the performance of production QWRs and HWRs at 4.3 K and 2 K and on performance limits. Results will be presented.

The possibility of L-band SRF elliptical cavity in order to accelerate heavy ion multi-charge-state beams is being investigated for accelerating energy higher than 200 MeV/u. A first simple analytic study was performed and the result showed that the longitudinal acceptance of 1288 MHz is sufficient for heavy-ion multi-charge-state (5 charge states) medium-beta linac. Encouraged this result, detail beam dynamic simulation took place. The cryogenic heat load is also calculated for this linac with taken into consideration cavity doping technology. In this paper, a summary of the beam dynamics and cryogen-ic heat load calculations for 1288 MHz linac for heavy-ion multi-charge-state (5 charge states) medium-beta beams.

The field emission effect is the mainly limitation for the operating of SRF cavities in higher gradient with stability. In this paper, the experiments were performed to evaluate the impact of the carbon contaminants and plasma cleaning on the performance of SRF cavity. Contamination mechanism was classified into cryogenic adsorption with weak strength and chemical deposition with strong strength. For the weak strength condition, the methane was injected into the SRF cavity during vertical test to make a cryogenic adsorption layer on the inner surface of the cavity. The results revealed that the performance of SRF cavity degraded by methane physical adsorption, but the performance can be recovered by thermal cycle the cavity to 300K and pump methane out. For the strong strength condition, the chemical deposited dirty layer of carbon contamination was produced by using of Ar/CH4 mixed PECVD method, and the SRF cavity performance was deteriorated by the severe field emission. Finally, carbon deposited cavity was treated by the Ar/O2 plasma, and its results revealed that the field emission removed greatly and the gradient was increased.

The commissioning of the 25 MeV high power and high intensity proton Linac demo for CiADS showed that the performance of the SRF cavities was mainly limited by field emission inside the cavities. Therefore, the techniques of helium processing and reactive oxygen plasma cleaning have been developed to mitigate field emission issues. We performed an experiment with a low beta HWR cavity exposed to air directly and processed by helium and reactive oxygen. In this paper, the details of the experiment will be described, the efficiency of helium processing and plasma cleaning will be compared and discussed

TESLA superconducting (SC) cavities are used for the acceleration of electron bunches at FLASH. The Higher Order Modes (HOMs) excited by the beam in these cavities may cause emittance growth. The misalignment of the cavities in a cryo-module is one of the essential factors which enhance the coupling of the HOMs to the beam. The cavity offset and tilt are the two most relevant misalignments. These can be measured by help of dipole modes, based on their linear dependence on the beam offset. The cavity offset has been measured before in several modules at FLASH. However, the cavity tilt has so far proved to be difficult to be measured, because the angular dependence of the dipole mode is much weaker. By carefully targeting the beam through the middle of a cavity, the strong offset contribution to the dipole fields could be reduced. Careful data analysis based on a fitting method enabled us then to extract the information on the cavity tilt. This measurement has been implemented in the cavities in one cryo-module at FLASH. First results of the ongoing measurements from several cavities are presented in this paper. It is for the first time that the cavity tilt in several cavities has been measured.

New potential applications of superconducting radio-frequency can be envisioned with conduction cooling of the cavities using cryocoolers. In this case, the total heat load to the cryocoolers have to be carefully managed to assure sufficient margin to operate the cavity at an acceptable accelerating gradient. The static and dynamic heat load from rf cables connected to the cavity can be a significant contribution to the total heat load. In this contribution we report the results from measurements of the temperature profile at 1.3 GHz for two low heat conductivity rf cables, as a function of the rf power and with one end of the cable in thermal contact with a liquid helium bath at 4.3 K. A parametric model of the two cables was developed with ANSYS to match the temperature profiles and calculate the heat load at the cold end of the cable.

The conceptual design report (CDR) for the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) has been published in September 2018. In this talk, the CDR design and prototyping of the HOM coupler for the CEPC Collider ring cavity will be given. Each cavity has two detachable coaxial HOM couplers mounted on the cavity beam pipe with HOM power handling capacity of 1 kW. A double notch coupler is chosen due to its wide bandwidth for the fundamental mode. A prototype of this HOM coupler and a coaxial line test bench have been fabricated and tested under low power. The low power test results agree well with the simulation results. The high power test was also carried out in room temperature.

CEPC will use a 650 MHz RF system with 240 2-cell cavities for the Collider. The Collider is a double-ring with shared cavities for Higgs operation and separate cavities for W and Z operations. The higher order modes (HOM) excited by the intense beam bunches must be damped to avoid additional cryogenic loss and multi-bunch instabilities. In this paper, the impedance budget and HOM damping and HOM power requirement for the CEPC Collider ring are given. This HOM power limit and the fast-growing longitudinal coupled-bunch instabilities (CBI) driven by both the fundamental and higher order modes impedance of the RF cavities determine to a large extent the highest beam current and luminosity obtainable in the Z mode. Two prototypes of HOM coupler have been fabricated and installed on the 650 MHz 2-cell cavity. The higher order modes were verified by bead pulling method. The Qe for the HOMs were also measured. A test bench with two 2-cell cavities was used to measure the real damping results and HOM propagating properties for a cavity string.

Higher Order Modes (HOM) absorbers for superconducting cavities have been developing at TOSHIBA in collaboration with High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) since 2015. A new prototype HOM absorber for 1.3 GHz 9-cell superconducting cavity was fabricated. An AlN lossy dielectrics cylinder was brazed with a thin copper plate, and the cool-down tests by nitrogen gas was carried out. The copper plate and a copper cylinder were joined by electron beam welding. SUS flanges were electron beam welded to both ends of the copper cylinder to fabricate a whole prototype HOM absorber. Fabrication process of the prototype HOM absorber will be presented in this paper.

Feedback operation at the European XFEL ensures an amplitude and phase stability of 0.01% and 0.01 deg, respectively. To reach such high RF field stability, model-based approaches for RF field system characterization and RF field controller design are in use. High demand on this system modelling is set especially to the characterization of additional passband modes for small bandwidth SRF cavities operated in pulsed mode and vector-sum regulation. This contribution discusses the developed "Advanced system setup tool" using a graphical user implementation in Matlab® for the RF field system characterization and the multiple-input-multiple-output feedback controller setup. Examples and current limitations will be presented.

Detuning of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities is mainly caused by the Lorentz force, which is the radiation pressure induced by a high radio frequency (RF) field, and environmental mechanical vibrations that induce undesirable interference signals referred to as microphonics. Both of these influences can be described by a second order differential equation of the mechanical vibration modes of the cavity. In this paper we consider three dominant mechanical modes of the system and develop a control scheme based on input-output linearization. It is shown through simulation studies that the proposed control technique can successfully the suppress microphonic noise due to the SRF cavity¿s dynamics.

A 166.6 MHz superconducting RF system has been proposed for the High Energy Photon Source (HEPS), a 6 GeV kilometer-scale light source. A 166.6MHz digital low-level RF system for HEPS-TF project has been developed firstly. And the digital low-level RF system has been successfully applied to the horizontal high power test of 166.6MHz superconducting cavity. The cavity field stability has been successfully achieved about ±0.03% (pk-pk) in amplitude and ±0.02 degree (pk-pk) in phase while the cavity field voltage is up to 1.2MV. It can meet the field stability requirements towards ±0.1% in ampli-tude and ±0.1 degree in phase of HEPS project. Further study and optimization of the system is under way.

Within TRIUMFs electron LINAC, two TESLA type cavities are operated with a single klystron in CW mode. Vector sum control is applied for field stabilization and the resonance frequencies are individually tuned with a proportional feedback controller. First operational experiences showed that amplitude oscillations can start in both cavities, while the vector sum is perfectly stable. These instabilities occur at high operating fields and are driven by Lorentz force changes. This paper presents a simulation study of multiple cavities in vector sum operation with respect to Lorentz force oscillations. It will be shown that all cavities in operation have to be damped to guarantee system stability.

Recent deployment of a digital LLRF system within the cavity testing framework of CERN’s vertical test cryostats has permitted a full revamp of cavity performance validation. With both full continuous and pulse mode operation, steady state a transient RF behaviour can be effectively probed. Due to direct and integrated control and monitoring of environmental test conditions, standard and novel RF measurement procedures have been developed and integrated into the testing infrastructure, along with a coherent data flow of high granularity measurement data. We present an overview of this cavity measurement system and address the underlying architectural structure, data handling and integration of user interfaces. In addition we highlight the benefits of variety of RF cavity measurements that can now be accommodated in our large 2 K cryostats.

At DESY, the development of a 1.6-cell, 1.3 GHz all superconducting gun cavity with a lead cathode attached to its back wall is ongoing. The special features of the structure like the back wall of the half-cell and cathode hole require adaptations of the procedures used for the treatment of nine-cell TESLA cavities. Unsatisfactory test results of two prototype cavities motivated us to re-consider the back-wall design and production steps. In this contribution we present the status of the modified cavity design including accessories causing accelerating field asymmetries, like a pick up antenna located at the back wall and fundamental power- and HOM couplers. Additionally, we discuss preliminary considerations for the compensation of kicks caused by these components.

Continuous wave (CW) photoinjectors have seen great progress in the last decades, such as DC gun, superconducting RF (SRF) gun and normal conducting (NC) gun. Developments of Free electron lasers and electron microscopy in the CW mode are pushing for further improvements of CW guns towards higher acceleration gradient, higher beam energy and compatibility with high QE cathodes for better beam brightness. Current SC gun gradient is limited by the cathode cell due to the complication of a cathode back plane and a normal conducting cathode plug, and R&D on SC gun improvement is ongoing. A high gradient cryocooled CW NC gun was proposed to house the high QE cathode, and a SC cavity immediately nearby gives further energy acceleration. In this paper, further RF optimization of the NC gun and ASTRA simulations of such a hybrid photoinjector are presented.

In order to optimize the next generation SRF gun at HZDR ELBE radiation source, the impact on beam dynamics from the SRF cavity geometry needs to be investigated. This paper presents an analysis on the electromagnetic fields and output electron beam qualities, by changing the geometry parameters of a 3.5-cell SRF gun cavity. The simulation results show the higher electric field ratio in the first half cell to the TESLA like cell, the better beam parameters we can obtain, which, however, will also lead to a higher Emax/E0 and Bmax/E0.

Two quadrupoles and one screen are used for beam transverse emittance measurements at HZDR ELBE. In this paper, the emittance calculated with two different methods, one with thin-lens approximation and the other one without this approximation, are compared and analized. To analyze the measurement error, quadrupole calibration is need. Two aspects about quadrupole analysis are made. The first one is quadrupole¿s effective length and strength and the second one is quadrupole¿s converged or diverged ability in reality.

Platform of Advanced Photon Source Technology R&D (PAPS) in the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) is an ongoing project, which aimed to provide a comprehensive research and testing platform for the particle accelerator, X-ray detection and optics. As one of the important parts of the platform, cryogenic vertical test stand for the superconducting cavities is composed of three big vertical test cryostats with 2 different inner diameters, which can provide 4.5K liquid helium, 2K superfluid helium and the lowest 1.5K environments according to the cavities test requirements. The cryogen-ic vertical test stands also focus on current international ¿hot spot¿ fast cool down to the superconducting cavi-ties, maximum liquid helium mass flow rate can be reached to 80g/s. Because of the big size of the cryostats and certain scale, the finished cryogenic vertical test stand can meet several different type cavities test, such as 1.3GHz 9cell, Spoke, elliptical, etc. And also can provide the cavities¿ mass vertical testing for the large scale superconducting accelerators.

The China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) is de-signed to produce spallation neutrons. CSNS upgrade is planned to increase beam power by inserting a SRF linac after drift tube linac (DTL). IHEP is developing a 325MHz double spoke cavity at ¿0 of 0.5 for the CSNS SRF linac. The cavity shape was optimized to minimize Ep/Ea while keeping Bp/Ep reasonably low. Meanwhile, mechanical design was applied to check stress, Lorentz force detuning and microphonic effects, and to minimize pressure sensitivity. A new RF coupling scheme was pro-posed to avoid electrons hitting directly on ceramic win-dow. After fabrication and post processing of cavity, the cavity reached Bp of 120mT at Eacc = 13.8MV/m and Q0 = 1.72·1010 under vertical test at 2K.

A cryomodule of 325 MHz Single Spoke Resonator type 1 (SSR1) superconducting RF cavities is being built at Fermilab for the PIP-II project. Twelve SSR1 cavities were manufactured in industry in USA (10 cavities) and India (2 cavities) and delivered to Fermilab. In this paper we present results of characterization of fully integrated jacketed cavities with high power coupler and tuner at the Fermilab Spoke Test Cryostat (STC).

Design of the high beta 650 MHz prototype cryomodule for PIP-II is currently undergoing at Fermilab. The cryomodule includes six 5-cell elliptical SRF cavities with accelerating voltage up to 20 MV and low heat dissipation (Q0 > 3·10zEhNZeHn). Characterization of performance of fully integrated jacketed cavities with high power coupler and tuner is crucial for the project. Such a characterization of jacketed cavity requires a horizontal test cryostat. Existing horizontal testing facilities at Fermilab, Horizontal Test Stand (HTS) and Spoke Test Cryostat (STC), are not large enough to accommodate jacketed 650 MHz 5-cell cavity. An upgrade of the STC is proposed to install extension to the cryostat and modify cryogenic connections and RF infrastructure to provide testing of 650 MHz cavities. In this paper we describe STC upgrade and commissioning of the upgraded facility. We discuss mitigation of issues and problems specific for testing of high Q0 650 MHz cavities, which require low residual magnetic field and low acoustic and mechanical vibrations environment.

Cryo Module Test Bench (CMTB) is a facility to perform tests on European XFEL like superconducting accelerating modules. The 120 kW Inductive Output Tube (IOT) installed in the facility allows driving the eight superconducting cavities inside the module under test in a vector-sum or single cavity control fashion with average Continuous Wave (CW) gradients higher than 20 MV/m. The scope of these tests is to evaluate the feasibility of upgrading European XFEL to CW operation mode. Following the successful tests done on a prototype module XM-3 the initial performance results on the production module XM50 will be presented in this paper. Because of European XFEL requirements, XM50 is equipped with modified couplers that allow a variable Loaded Quality factor(QL) to values higher than 4x107. A cost relevant open question is the maximum QL that can be reached while maintaining the system within the European XFEL field stability specifications of 0.01 % in amplitude and 0.01 deg in phase. Because of this, the LLRF system capability of rejecting microphonic and RF disturbances, as well as Lorentz Force Detuning (LFD) related effects in open and closed loop is of prime interest.

In recent years there has been much discussion on thermoelectric effects and their role in flux expulsion during cool down of SRF cavities. Magnetic field is often measured to asses both flux expulsion as the cavity undergoes superconducting transition, and thermoelectric currents due to spatial thermal gradients. As a complementary view, in this paper we show direct measurement of the thermoelectric current independent from the expulsion measurement of the magnetic field. In our setup the azimuthally symmetric cavity is vertically installed and the thermal gradient is along the symmetry axis allowing to describe the cool down behavior of the thermoelectric current using simple coupled simulations.

The ESS elliptical superconducting Linac consists of two types of 704.42 MHz cavities, medium and high beta, to accelerate the beam from 216 MeV up to the final energy at 2 GeV. The medium and high-beta parts of the Linac are composed of 36 and 84 elliptical cavities, with geometrical beta values of 0.67 and 0.86 respectively. CEA Saclay is in charge of the cavity prototypes that is designing, manufacturing, testing and integrating them into demonstrator cryomodules. We have manufactured 6 medium beta and 5 high beta cavities and we present here the latest results concerning these activities.

We have manufactured 6 medium beta and 5 high beta cavities. As part of these activities we are interested in field emission as one of the limiting factors for cavity performances. We are currently collecting data from cavities operated in vertical cryostat and inside cryomodules. Analysis are carried out by means of particle tracking simulation and comparison with radiation dose monitor and scintillators.

The large inkind scope of the elliptical superconducting RF linac of the ESS facility implies the handling of handover conditions between the cavities fabrication and testing phases performed at INFN and STFC, to the assembly of cryomodules at CEA and later to ESS in Lund. The performance qualification at the module test stand, and later the commissioning and operation phases require the availability of the cavity performance and frequency data under all environmental conditions during preparation (e.g. temperature, vacuum in beam line/He vessel/vacuum vessel, tuner state). Availability of the data needs to be guaranteed for the long term maintainability of the accelerator. For these reasons a cavity database has been set up at ESS, integrating the data contained in the handover documentation from the inkind partners and extending it during the activities at ESS after receiving the modules. The database has been used to analyze the preparation steps of the prototype demonstrator cryomodule for the tests at ESS, by benchmarking with the data collected during the tests at CEA, and is currently used during the series cavities handover phases.

DESY has started setting up a test laboratory for niobium more than 20 years ago. The initial application was to assure required surface quality of niobium sheets before its forming to half cells for the 1.3 GHz SRF Tesla shape cavities. As a first test equipment DESY developed a basic eddy current test device which was refined continuously. Since that time the laboratory grew with the requirements on R&D activities for niobium raw material and its semi-finished products. To be able to assure the Quality of niobium products needed for the European XFEL series cavity production, the Lab¿s infrastructure was updated significantly. Now the capabilities of the test laboratory cover the investigation of the fundamental physical properties of various materials including for example mechanical properties, surface, microstructure and chemical composition analysis. The Quality Assurance for the European XFEL was performed successfully on an outstanding level and in the meantime the laboratory was used for several other projects like LCLS-II and ESS. We present DESY’s test infrastructure as well as applied methods for the Quality Assurance and R&D activities and we report about experiences.

A newly built cleanroom is under commissioning at the Helmholtz-Institute Mainz (HIM). In its ISO-class 6 area vacuum components and cavities can be cleaned in different ultrasonic baths and in a dedicated conductance rinsing bath. In the ISO-class 4 area a large vacuum oven offers the possibility for comprehensive drying. A high pressure rinsing cabinet (HPR) has been installed between the two cleanroom areas to be loaded and unloaded from both sides. Complete cold-strings have to be mounted in the ISO-class 4 area and to be rolled out of the cleanroom on a rail system installed on the floor. All installations and tools have been integrated to treat and assemble superconducting 217 MHz multigap crossbar cavities for the Helmholtz Linear Accelerator (HELIAC), which is under development by HIM and GSI. Those crossbar cavities have a diameter of 650 mm and a weight of up to 100 kg. The cleanroom will be also used for the Mainz Energy-Recovering Superconducting Accelerator (MESA) project, processing the TESLA/XFEL type 9-cell cavities and other beamline components. This paper reports on the commissioning of the cleanroom and shows the features of the different installations.

To explore the fundamental properties of superconducting materials used in modern particle accelerators, high precision surface resistance measurements in a dedicated testing equipment is of key importance. The quadrupole resonator, originally developed at CERN, and then successfully modified at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin, is ideally suited for characterization of samples at temperatures of 1.8 K to > 20 K, RF fields of up to 120 mT and frequencies of 433 MHz, 866 MHz and 1.3 GHz. In the past years, this set-up has been subject of intensive research on both its capabilities and limitations. Yet, one of the main challenges is the accuracy of the surface resistance measurement, which is determined by both the uncertainty in the RF measurement and manufacturing imperfections related to the production tolerances such as quenching and chemical polishing processes, etc. In this contribution, we focus on the influence of key geometrical parameters on operating the quadrupole resonator at the third mode, since the surface resistance measurement shows some unexpected behavior for this frequency.

The superconducting (SC) heavy ion HElmholtz LInear ACcelerator (HELIAC) is under development at GSI in Darmstadt in cooperation with Helmholtz Institute Mainz (HIM) and Goethe-University Frankfurt (GUF). A novel design is used for the accelerating cavities, namely SC continuous wave (CW) multigap Crossbar H-Mode cavities. For this a dedicated beam dynamics layout - the EQUidistant mUltigap Structure (EQUUS) - has been carried out a couple of years ago and is under further development. In December 2018 the GSI High Charge State Injector (HLI) delivered heavy ion beam to the already commissioned first of series superconducting RF cavity. Proper 6D-matching to the CH cavity demands sufficient beam characterisation. Slit-grid emittance measurements provided for the transverse phase space determination. By measuring the longitudinal projection of the bunch with a Feschenko Monitor (Beam Shape Monitor), the bunch profile was obtained. With a dedicated algorithm, the full longitudinal phase space at the HLI-exit could be reconstructed from a set of BSM measurements. The basic reconstruction method, all relevant BSM measurements and the resulting phase space reconstruction will be presented.

In this article the numerically estimated BBU instability behaviors of a 9 cell superconducting TESLA cavity are presented for first two pass-band trapped dipole modes (18 in all). The given BBU threshold current values are calculated by the method of beam energy gain averaging on phases of dipole mode fields. BBU instability behaviors in cases of applying the cavities in Linacs as well in Energy Recovery Linacs (ERLs) are considered. The BBU influence on beam emittance degradation is demonstrated. Examples for suppression of beam BBU oscillations by a solenoid focusing and applying of an external RF generator with a feedback are visualized.

The SRF cavity testing facilities at CERN include four vertical cryostat stations in SM18 and a cryostat for small cavities in the Cryolab. A large range of structures are tested, from Nb thin film cavities for HIE-Isolde and LHC, to bulk Nb crab cavities for HiLumi or 704 MHz 5-cell high-gradient cavities. To cope with different shapes and small series tests, thermal mapping diagnostics is deployed by sensing second sound in superfluid helium. A new type of Transition Edge Sensors (TES) has been developed in the last 2 years. These are miniature resistors of thin-film superconducting alloys, micro-produced on insulating wafers. An extensive campaign of optimization of design, fabrication process and composition was accompanied by qualification in a calibration cryostat. Reproducibility, stability, then intensity, distance and angular dependence of the response were assessed and compared to Oscillating Superleak Transducers (OST). The TES were then installed in a vertical cryostat for tests of a prototype crab cavity for HiLumi. TES are now applied to quench localization on high gradient cavities, for which the most recent results will be presented, together with the OST results.

In the framework of HL-LHC, a new infrastructure was installed in 2018, to test SRF structures in the proton beams of the SPS. Scope of the test stand is to study the operational performance of crab cavities for HL-LHC – more generally, SRF cavities – through a wide range of proton beam parameters up to high energy and current, under safe conditions for equipment and personnel. The SPS beam instrumentation is used to monitor orbit centering, RF phase scans, bunch rotation. To minimize impact on beam time, infrastructure and services allow for full remote control. Critical aperture restrictions is overcome by placing the test structure and its ancillaries on a motorized table for lateral translation in- and out of beam. Two articulated Y-shaped vacuum chambers connect the test cryomodule on a beam by-pass. A new cryogenic refrigerator is installed in a split scheme, with an underground cold box fed from a surface compressor. The two Inductive Output Tubes (IOT) power amplifiers deliver up to 60 kW cw via coaxial transmission lines to the two cavities and charges and circulators, the latter installed on the translation table. Interlocks and safety equipment complete the test stand.
